# Links to other modules 
## Module A 
Structural biology methods can be used to elucidate the processes involved in gene expression and regulation. 

## Module C
After translation, proteins are targeted and sorted to different parts of the cell. 

## Module D 
When cellular processes go wrong. 
"Each regulatory point in the control of gene expression (which includes chromatin structure, splicing and polyadenylation of mRNA precursors, translation, and mRNA and protein stability) is subject to profound alterations during the development of most, if not all, cancers" (David & Manley, 2010)
