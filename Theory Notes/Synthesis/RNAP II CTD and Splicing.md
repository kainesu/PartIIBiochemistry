# RNAP II CTD and Splicing

- CTD appears to act as a landing platform, recruiting various spliceosome components onto the pre-MRNA, including polypyrimidine tract binding protein-associated splicing factor (PSF), U2AF65 (Review – [[CustodioCarmo-Fonseca_2016]]), and Mud1 (a subcomplex of U1)

- S5P CTD increases transiently at a splicing-related transcription checkpoint towards the 3' splice site ([[AlexanderEtAl_2010]], [[ChathothEtAl_2014a]])
	- P-TEFb phosphorylates CTD during elongation (Price, 2000) (How is P-TEFb phosphorylation of S5 regulated? Why does it increase towards the 3' SS?)

- S5P can then recruit U1 spliceosome components during transcription, e.g. Mud1 ([[HarlenEtAl_2016a]])
	- ??? but U1 recognises 5' splice site? (according to IB notes)
	- ChIP-nexus of U1 subcomplex Mud1 and S5P found that Mud1 occupancy and S5P coincide exactly in a 200bp region just downstream of the 3' splice site of high U1 occupancy genes 
	- Loss of S5P also disrupts splicing 
		- Replaced S5 of first eight repeats in CTD with Ala

- Thr4 may be involved in post-transcriptional splicing ([[HarlenEtAl_2016a]])
	- Thr4P does not interact with spliceosome subunits 
	- ChIP-nexus of Thr4 showed that there is high levels of Thr4 after spliceosome dissociates
	- However, Thr4 does not cause the dissociation, but is a mark of spliceosome release 
		- U1 and U2 occupancy profiles not altered in Thr4Val mutant. 
	- Thr4Val replacement resulted in 90% of spliced genes having greater intron retention

- Splicing and CTD phosphorylation may also be bidirectional (Koga et al 2015)
	- Inhibition of splicing *in vivo* reduced S2P 

- Involvement of liquid-liquid phase separation? (Maita & Nakagawa 2019)

- How is S5P removed after splicing is complete? 
	- S5P phosphatases e.g. Rtr1 (Mosley et al 2009)


# Gaps in literature
- Variation in resolution of S5P across the length of genes. 
- What enzymes are responsible for phosphorylating and desphorylating S5 as it moves across the gene? And how do these enzymes "know" when to phosphorylate/desphosphorylate? Not clear what mediates regulation of S5P. 
- Why is a single chemical modification sufficient to change the affinity of CTD for these factors? Seems that phosphorylation may result in some larger conformational change in CTD?
