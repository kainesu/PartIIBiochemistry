# Module C (core)
Module C (core) is concerned with the transport and sorting of proteins after their synthesis to different sites and compartments in the cell. 

Proteins are first targeted to the ER for post-translational modifications:

> Targeting proteins to the ER 

**Essay**
- [[Discuss the mechanisms that ensure the correct selection of proteins to be targeted to the endoplasmic reticulum for membrane insertion or secretion.]]

**Outlines**
- [[Many different types and topologies of integral membrane proteins are inserted into the endoplasmic reticulum. How well do we understand these processes of membrane protein targeting and insertion?]]

They are then sent to the Golgi for sorting to different parts of the cell:

> 1. Protein folding and quality control in the ER
> 2. Anterograde transport from ER to Golgi involving COP II
> 3. Retrograde transport from late to early Golgi and from Golgi to ER involving COP I
> 4. SNARE target vesicles to destination membranes 
> 5. Clathrin-mediated endocytosis
> 6. Endosomal pathway 

**Detailed outline**
- [[What mechanisms in the secretory pathway facilitate efficient quality control in protein folding and protein targeting?]]

The cytoskeleton facilitates the transport of these vesicles, and also performs motility functions for the cell:
