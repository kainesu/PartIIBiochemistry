# Microtubules 
## Functions
- Maintain cell shape
- Tracks for motors to move cargo 
- Mitotic spindle
- Maintain distribution of organelle e.g. ER is aligned along microtubules 
- Cilia and flagella 

## Structure
- Made up of tubulin, a stable heterodimer of alpha-tubulin (GTP) and beta-tubulin (GTP/GDP)
	- Alpha-tubulin is always attached to GTP, while at beta-tubulin, GTP can be hydrolysed to GDP, driving microfilament polymerisation 
- Tubulin dimers assemble head to tail with the same orientation into protofilaments 
- 13 protofilaments on average form a cylindrical structure that is stiffer than actin or intermediate filaments 
- Microtubules are polar structures with a fast-growing (+) end and slow-growing (-) end
	- (-) is typically anchored at MTOC (centrosome, spindle pole, or basal body)
		- MTOC = pair of centrioles surrounded by a matrix that initiates nucleation from gamma-tubulin 
- Beta-tubulin is exposed on (+) end while alpha-tubulin is exposed on (-) end. 
![[Pasted image 20230402145748.png|400]]
## Assembly 
- Dimers of alpha- and beta-tubulin bind to GTP and assemble onto (+) end of microtubules 
- After incorporation into the microtubule, the molecule of GTP bound to beta tubulin is hydrolysed into GDP through interdimer contacts along the microtubule profilament 
- Dimers containing beta-tubulin-GTP tend to assemble, while dimers bound to GDP tend to fall apart 

## Modification of microtubule properties 
- Tubulin isoforms – there are 3 alpha-tubulin isoforms and 5 beta-tubulin isoforms that each have different assembly properties and affinities for microtubule-associated proteins (MAPs) 
- Post-translational modifications can alter the stability and spatial distribution of the microtubules 
	- Lysine-40 acetylation 
	- Detyrosination 
	- Polyglutamylation (EEE)
	- Polyglycylation (GGG) 
- Modified tubulin subunits that stabilise microtubules can be found in centrioles, primary cilium and in a subset of cytoplasmic microtubules 

## Microtubule-associated proteins (MAPs)
- #structural_evidence Szymon & Carolyn () – cryo-EM structures of microtubules with MAPs 
- MAPs regulate microtubule assembly and architecture 
	- Sequester tubulin monomers
	- Sever microtubules
	- Control polymerisation
	- Stabilise microtubules 
- E.g. Tau is a MAP that stabilises microtubules in neurons 
	- In Alzheimer's disease, tau is hyperphosphorylated, causing it to be released from microtubules
	- Microtubules are destabilised and tau aggregates into neurofibrillary tangles 

## Studying microtubule dynamics 
### Drugs 
- Nocodazole – inhibits microtubule assembly by binding to tubulin dimers 
- Colchicine – binds to tubulin dimers and inhibits MT assembly 
- Vinblastine – inhibits microtubule assembly 
	- Fast-dividing cells tend to be affected more by inhibition of microtubules, which are involved in mitosis 
- Taxol – binds beta-tubulin to stabilise microtubules 

# Actin
## Examples of actin use in the cell
See Kaksonen et al Nat Rev MCB 2006 for image
Listeria actin comet tails 

- Control of cell shape 
- Cell motility 
- Muscle contraction 
- Cytokinesis 
- Intracellular trafficking 

## Actin assembly and disassembly 
- G-actin monomer assembles into filaments constrains variety of actin that exist
- 3 G-actin monomers assemble into a nucleus, which creates more interfaces for more subsequent monomers to bind 
	- Nucleation is the rate-limiting step for polymerisation 
- Critical concentration of actin required for polymerisation to occur – concentration at which rate of subunit addition = rate of subunit loss 
- Filament has a polarity, with a fast-growing barbed (+) end and a slow-growing pointed (-) end. 
- During polymerisation, ATP bound to G-actin is hydrolysed to ADP bound F-actin. Hydrolysis occurs in two steps – cleavage of ATP, followed by slower release of inorganic phosphate (Pi). 
- ATP hydrolysis confers polarity which results in treadmilling. Tend to associate at barbed end, and dissociate at pointed end

## Regulation of actin dynamics 
- How do cells control where and when actin polymerises? 

### Arp2/3 complex promotes nucleation and branched actin 
- Arp 2/3 is the main nucleating protein for actin. It is a complex of 7 proteins and has a very similar fold to actin itself to aid nucleation of filaments. 
- Binds to mother filaments and makes characteristic 70° angle 
![[Pasted image 20230208211336.png|450]]
See Goley and Welch Nat Rev MCB for image 

#### N-WASP is an activator of Arp2/3 complex 
- N-WASP works by relief of autoinhibition. There are 2 binding sites for N-WASP on Arp2/3
- N-WASP itself regulated by lipids, Cdc42 GTPase
![[Pasted image 20230208211459.png|425]]

## Elongators and bundlers 
**Elongators** 
- ENA
- VASP
- Formin 

**Bundlers** 
- microspikes 
- alpha actinin – has wider spacing than fascin 
- Fascin 

### G proteins involved in cytoskeleton regulation 
![[Pasted image 20230208213039.png|300]]
#### Rac 
- #experimental_evidence Ridley et al (1992) injected constitutively active or dominant negative Rac into cells and looked at membrane ruffling and actin architecture. 

#### Cdc42 promotes filopodia formation 
- #experimental_evidence Nobes et al (1992) – injection of constitutively active Cdc42 promotes filopodia formation 
- PI(4,5)P<sub>2</sub> activates Cdc42 to convert it to GTP-bound state and causing actin polymerisation 
	- #experimental_evidence Ma et al (1998) – showed that frog egg extracts with liposome added containing PIP2 with fluorescently labelled actin, can see actin comet tails. 
- [ ] MYO6 attached to actin can recruit LRCH3, which in turn recruits the Rac1/Cdc42 GEF DOCK7. DOCK7 activates Rac1/Cdc42 to remodel the actin cytoskeleton

#### RhoGTPase 
- #experimental_evidence Nobes et al (1992) injected constitutively active Rho and found that it promoted stress fibre formation and adhesive reorganisation 

### Toca-1 
- #experimental_evidence Ho et al (2005) – Used biochemical fractionation to determine downstream pathways of Cdc42. Fractionated cells by sucrose gradient centrifugation, then added different fractions in vitro to check whether the fraction exhibited actin assembly activity under the microscopy. When Arp2/3 + N-Wasp is added with an active fraction containing Toca-1, actin polymerisation can be seen under the microscope
	- Not quantitative data but able to draw a meaningful conclusion! 

## Cdc42, N-WASP, Toca-1, and Arp2-3 complex form a pathway to polymerise action 
![[Pasted image 20230208214140.png|475]]

## Clathrin-mediated endocytosis 
[[C2 PTMs and Protein trafficking#Endocytosis]]
- In yeast, there is stereotypical recruitment of endocytic proteins, while in mammals, actin is not always involved in endocytosis (only required for endocytosis from apical domain of polarised cells)
- Yeast have got harsher environment, not inside body, so turgor pressure on membrane, so extra force may be needed to bud vesicles in yeast 
- WASP/Myosin complex is required for actin to participate in budding vesicles 
	- Complex recruitment, Arp2/3 activation, phospholipid anchoring, myosin motor activity 
	- #experimental_evidence Lewellyn et al (2015) – KO 6 proteins and make artificial fusion protein to substitute. Fusion protein rescued function.
![[Pasted image 20230208212510.png|300]]
- Actin depolymerisation increases the number of clathrin-coated pits at the apical domain of polarised epithelial cells 
- #experimental_evidence Akamatsu et al (2020) quantified number of Arp2/3 complexes by using nanocages and a system to recruit them to the membrane in a controlled manner. These nanocages can assembly into different n-mers, and use them as a standard curve for fluorescence intensity under microscope. By comparing fluorescence intensity of recruited Arp2/3 to standard curve of nanocages, able to quantify number recruited. 
- #structural_evidence Serwas et al (2022) used Cryo-ET to visualise the actin network involved in endocytosis. Found many long actin filaments, which may be involved in stabilising the membrane and thus allowing endocytosis to occur 

## Model for lamellipodial protrusion 
- Lamellipodia contain Arp2/3-mediated branched actin 
- ENA/VASP proteins tune the branching density in lamellipodia 
	- #experimental_evidence Bear et al (2002) – 
	- Localization affects length of branches (how? Read Bear et al 2002)
- They do this by antagonising capping protein, which prevents elongation by inserting a tentacle to block the barbed end
- Actin elongators are *anti-cappers*, they also sit on the cap and prevent capping protein. Sometimes they also add on actin monomers as well. These activities are difficult to differentiate. 
	- #experimental_evidence Hansen et al (2010) – 
- Actin is difficult to KO as it affects many processes in the cell, not specific 
- Severing and depolymerisation of actin is also needed for motility and dynamics 
	- #experimental_evidence Brieher et al (2008) – Purified ADF/cofilin, Aip1 and Coronin identified by fractionation assays and assay on Listeria tails 
- Bundling proteins increase stiffness of actin filaments and align them in different orientations e.g. alpha actin – anti parallel orientation. 
	- #experimental_evidence Loisel et al (1999)
- Dendritic nucleation model (Pollard 2003)
1. Extracellular stimuli produces active GTPases and PIP2
2. These activate WASP/Scar
3. Activate Arp2/3 complex to nucleate new daughter filaments on mother filament at 70° angle 
4. Position barbed ends against membrane
5. Growing filaments push membrane forward
6. Capping protein terminates elongation
7. Ageing of filaments
8. ADP/cofilin severs and depolymerises ADP-actin filaments 
9. Profilin catalyses exchange of ADP to ATP to regenerate a pool of ATP-actin bound to profilin 

## Filopodia formation 
### Model of formation is controversial, but three have been proposed: 
1. De novo nucleation by formins
2. Convergent elongation by Arp2/3 complex and Ena/VASP
3. I BAR proteins recruiting elongators and bundlers by fascin 

Cell free system of filopodia-like systems – Lee et al (2010) 

### Tip complex is heterogenous, an actin bundles grow and shrink in a distinct pattern in the filopodia 

### Formins are elongators regulated by Rho GTPases 
Higgs (2005)

### Filopodia are bundled by fascin 
- Fascin is a cancer target to prevent metastasis 

### MYO10 stimulates filopodia in U2OS cells 

### I-BAR and fascin reconstitution lead to filopodia formation 
Tsai et al (2022)
However, some heterogeneity

** Heterogeneity of actin regulation depending on context and processes, species 

## Myosin-actin interaction 
### Tropomyosins regulate myosin-actin interaction 
- Tropomyosins are long coiled coil proteins that align along the groove of actin filaments 
- >40 different tropomyosin isoforms, and different cell types express different isoforms
- Different isoforms associate with different actin populations in the cell (e.g. apical vs basolateral), regulating which myosin motors can interact with the actin filaments 
	- E.g. TM3.1 isoform, can recruit non-muscle myosin 2 to translocate along actin filaments 
	- E.g. TM2 isoform inhibits myosin 1c recruitment 

## Cross-talk between actin and microtubules 
- Microtubules and actin filaments are bundled/linked by cross-linking proteins (tau and fascin)
- Microtubule (+) end complexes can nucleate actin filaments from the (+) end 
- Microtubules can be captured at actin-rich sites, e.g. focal adhesions 
- Actin filaments have also been discovered inside the lumen of a microtubule 
	- #experimental_evidence Paul et al (2020)

See Pimm & Kenty-Ridilla (2021)

## Studying actin filament dynamics
### Drugs 
- Phalloidin – binds to F-actin at junction between subunits to stabilise and label actin filaments 
- Cytochalasin – Binds to (+) end of actin filaments to prevent elongation and depolymerisation from the (-) end
	- Can be used in live cells  to study processes that depend on F-actin structures
- Lantrunculin A: destabilises actin filaments in cells by sequestering actin monomers 

# Septins 
- Septins organise into rings in the cytosol 
- LRCH3 links MYO6 to RhoGEF DOCK7 and to septin cytoskeleton
	- LRCH4 binds directly to MYO6 and actin via calponin homology domain 
	- DOCK7 is a GEF for Rac1 and CDC42
	- #experimental_evidence Overexpression of LRCH3/Dock7 leads to reorganisation of septin filaments while the actins are unaffected 

# Cytoskeletal motors 
## Myosin 
### Functions
- Transport/tethering of endosomes and secretory vesicles in cortical actin network 
- Myosins target a variety of intracellular comparrtments, protein complexes, RNPs 

### Structure 
- N-terminal Motor domain contains 2 binding sites, one for ATP and one for filament track 
	- ATP-dependent conformational changes in MD result in movement along linear track 
	- Motor domain produces force for translocation along the actin track 
	- ATP hydrolysis results in conformational changes that is transmitted through the relay helix and the converter region, and is amplified by the lever arm 
	- #structural_evidence Rayment et al (1993)
- Regulatory neck region contains 1-6 IQ motifs for calmodulin/light chain binding
	- Acts as mechanical lever arm to transmit small conformational changes of the catalytic domain into nanometer displacements at the end of the lever arm 
- Tail domain has diverse structure, containing coiled coils and various other domains
	- Mediate dimerisation via coiled coils 
	- Cargo binding 

### Myosin unfolding and activation 
- Many myosin classes are autoinhibitory, and are folded up in an inactivated state. Different triggers can cause unfolding to activate myosin 
	- In non-muscle myosin II, phosphorylation of regulatory light chain can trigger unfolding and filament formation, and thus activation of the myosin 
		- #experimental_evidence Citi & Kendrick-Jones (1986)
		  ![[Pasted image 20230402155014.png|325]]
	- In myosin V, Ca2+ and cargo binding regulate unfolding and activation 

### Myosin cargo binding 
- After autoinhibited state is released, adaptor proteins bind to the C-terminal domain to mediate and regulate cargo binding, as well as actin assembly.
- At cargo destination, cargo is detached and adaptor proteins can promote actin disassembly. Motor returns to autoinhibited state
![[Pasted image 20230402155531.png|175]]

### Myosin walk 
1. ATP displaces ADP in motor domain 
	1. ATP binding causes myosin to rapidly release from actin 
	2. ATP hydrolysis to ADP-Pi causes movement of head to pre-powerstroke position 
2. Binding of head to new position on actin results in Pi dissociation, causing tight actin binding -> powerstroke

- Myosin V walks along actin filaments using a hand-over-hand movement 
- Both heads are bound 36 nm apart 
- For some myosin classes, the load carried by the motor can affect ADP release – a high load reduces the ADP dissociation rate, resulting in a tether (rather than a moving motor, as powerstroke is inhibited)
- #structural_evidence Walker et al (2000)

### Motor properties 
- Myosins adapt their kinetic cycle and motor properties to fulfil specific cellular functions 
- Important properties of motors include
	- Step size
	- Duty ratio = how long myosin remains attached to actin filament 
	- Velocity/speed
	- Directionality
	- Processivity 
- #experimental_evidence Using optical tweezers, an actin filament can be trapped between two beads held in place by a split laser beam, which is then lowered onto an anchored myosin motor. Position of beads in xy plane can be monitored to measure the displacement of the actin filament by the myosin head.
	- E.g. As myosin V shows a "staircase" pattern of actin filament displacement, it suggests that there are multiple events of binding and release -> processive 
	- Measured step size of 36 nm for myosin V (step size is measured by the height of each step)

#### Processivity may be regulated by dimerisation state 
- Native purified MYO6 motor is a monomer, but binding to interacting proteins such as Dab2 that MYO6 to cargo vesicles can induce dimerisation 
- Monomeric MYO6 is non-processive while dimeric MYO6 is processive and can transport vesicles 
	- #experimental_evidence Lister et al (2004)
	- #experimental_evidence Yu et al (2009)
- 1 motor could perform different cellular functions depending on its dimerisation state, which is in turn regulated by cargo interaction 
#comment watch lecture for this part 

#### Step size may be regulated by length of lever arm 
- Step size of a single myosin head is determined by the distance it walks along an actin filament, as well as by ATP hydrolysis
- The longer the neck = more IQ motifs -> longer lever arm and step size 
	- #experimental_evidence Purcell et al (2002)
- Myosin V has a step size of 36 nm, as a step size of 36 nm is required to walk one one side of the actin helix 

![[Pasted image 20230402153454.png|150]]

#### Velocity is regulated by lever arm length 
- Maximal speed of myosin V-driven secretory vesicle movement is linearly linked to number of IQ motifs. 
- Velocity can be measured using *in vitro* motility assays 
	- #experimental_evidence In *in vitro* motility assay, myosins are fixed to a surface, and a fluorescently-labelled actin is flowed onto the myosins -> movement of actin filaments can be observed under a microscope to see what direction the myosins move 
		- Most myosins walk towards the (+) end of the actin filaments, except MYO6 
- However, a longer lever arm reduces force due to reduced stiffness 

#### Different myosin motors have different directionality 
- Myosins can only move along the actin filament in 1 direction (i.e. they are unidirectional) 
- Unlike other myosins, MYO6 has opposite directionality, walking towards the (-) end of filaments instead of (+) end 
- This is because MYO6 has a 52aa insertion ("reverse gear") between the converter and lever arm 
![[Pasted image 20230402154000.png|375]]
- The insert changes the orientation of the lever arm such that it is directed towards the (-) end of the actin during the power stroke 
	- #experimental_evidence Replacement of MYO6 neck domain containing the "reverse gear" with the 6 IQ motif-lever arm of myosin V results in MYO6 that moves towards (+) end of actin filament 
- #experimental_evidence Wells et al (1999)
- Reverse directionality of MYO6 may be needed to direct the formation of APPL1-positive signalling endosomes 
	- Wt MYO6 is present on APPL-1 positive signalling endosomes in cell periphery 
	- When MYO6 engineered to move in reverse direction (towards + end), filopodia formed at cell periphery instead, with accumulation of APPL-1 signalling endosomes at base of periphery
![[Pasted image 20230402154359.png|325]] ^1a9e3f

### Termination of transport and cargo-release 

## Kinesin
### Functions
- In axons, transport cargo towards synapse
- In unpolarised cells, kinesins move cargo from perinuclear region to plasma membrane
- In cilia, kinesin 2 are involved in anterograde transport towards the tip 
- Involved in mitosis and meiosis for spindle organisation, chromosome capture and movement, cytokinesis 

### Structure 
- Conserved motor domain 
	- The position of the motor domain along the kinesin determines its function 
		- N-kinesin (N-terminal) – microtubule (+)-end directed transport 
		- C-kinesin – microtubule (-) end directed transport 
		- M-kinesin – depolymerise microtubules 
- Divergent tail for specific functions 

### Motor properties 
- Kinesis can move bidirectionally along microtubules
- Processive motor, hand over hand mechanism 
- 8 nm step size, with 1 ATP hydrolysis/step 

### Unfolding and activation 
- In absence of cargo, kinesin activity is tightly controlled by autoinhibition 
- Inactive kinesin adopts a folded conformation, where tail directly binds to an inhibits motor domain
- Autoinhibition can be relieved by cargo binding or by tail phosphorylation 

### Cargo attachment
- Kinesin can attach directly to phospholipids in membranes (e.g. for vesicle transport), to transmembrane adaptors (e.g. AP1), or to scaffolding proteins
	- Many of these cargoes are related to [[C2 PTMs and Protein trafficking]]! 
- Cargo attachment occurs via tail domain or light chains 
- Cargo attachment is regulated by phosphorylation, RabGTPases, or Ca2+ 

![[Pasted image 20230402160418.png|425]]

### Termination 
- MAPs induce transport termination in a motor-specific manner
	- E.g. kinesin-1 movement is terminated by tau 
	- Kinesin-3 senses nucleotide state of microtubule lattice for termination, detaching at GTP-rich microtubule (+) end

### Plant kinesins have undergone diversification 
- Plants express homologous motor proteins to animals, but there are also many differences
- Dynein is not expressed in plants. As such, the number of kinesin-14 family members is much higher for transport to minus end of MT, to compensate for lack of dynein 
- Plant kinesins have adopted novel functions different to animal counterparts 

## Evolution of myosin and kinesin motor proteins
- Myosins, kinesis, and G proteins have evolved from a common ancestor that has a nucleotide-switch (i.e. a protein which changes conformation depending on its nucleotide state and has intrinsic hydrolysis activity)
- Both myosin and kinesin share a common core motor domain structure that converts energy from ATP hydrolysis to generate similar conformational changes to drive protein motion 

## Dyneins 
### Functions
- (-) end directed microtubule motors 
- Cytoplasmic dynein 1 
	- transports diverse cargoes towards cell centre
	- retrograde axonal transport
	- Functions in mitotic cells
- Cytoplasmic dynein 2
	- Present at base and within flagella and cilia
	- Retrograde intraflagellar transport 

### Structure 
- Large multi-subunit complexes that are unrelated to myosins or kinesins
- Higher eukaryotes have 10-15 heavy chain genes that fall into two major classes (cytoplasmic or axonemal)
- 9+2 arrangement of microtubules in axoneme of flagella and cilia
	- Axonemal dynein is connected to outer microtubule (A), and heads move along the (B) microtubules 
	- Outer dynein has three heads, while inner dynein has two heads 
![[Pasted image 20230402161204.png|250]]
- Motor domain is larger than myosin or kinesin, and is evolutionarily unrelated 
	- Contains 6 AAA+ ATPase domains, but hydrolysis of only one ATP required per power stroke
- Swing of linker domain produces force for movement along microtubule 

![[Pasted image 20230402161740.png|175]]
- 2 dynein heavy chains (blue) attached to motor domains (grey), 2 dynein intermediate chains (green), 2 dynein light intermediate chains (yellow), and several light chains.

### Motor properties 
- Stepsize is variable – 8-32nm, with average of 10-12nm 
- Dynein takes frequent backsteps and can also step sideways, unlike kinesin and myosin V 
- **Inchworm** steps with occasional hand-over-hand (20% of time)
- Dynein motor domains step independently, in contrast to kinesin and myosin where there is **gating** #question what does this mean? 

### Cargo attachment 
- Cytoplasmic dynein is attached to organelles and vesicles by a separate dynactin complex, which is built around a short actin filament 
  ![[Pasted image 20230402161937.png|275]]
- An adaptor protein bridges dynein to dynactin, promoting formation of processive dynein-dynactin complex 
	- Different adaptors exist for different functions, e.g. BICD2 for nuclear transport, NINL for centrosome transport 
![[Pasted image 20230402161921.png|300]]
- Dynein-dynactin associates with an adaptor, which in turn associates with a Rab attached to the membrane of the vesicle
	- For Golgi-derived vesicles, dynactin attaches to adaptor BICDL1 or BICD2, which then binds to Rab6
	- For early endosomes, dynein-dynactin attaches to adaptor Hook which then binds to Rab5 
![[Pasted image 20230402162201.png|400]]

## Motor interaction 
- Motors can form dimers or work independently in small groups or arrays as monomers
	- De Jonge et al (2019) 
- Some cargoes can be bound to different kinds of motors with opposing directionality 
	- E.g. axonal transport vesicles can be purified with 1-5 dynein, 1 kinesin-1, and 1-3 kinesin-2
	- This results in vesicles moving bidirectionally with frequent switches and pauses along the neuronal axon 
	- Optical trapping data suggests that 4-8 weak dynein motors are required to oppose a single strong kinesin motor 
- Binding to multiple kinds of motors can regulate cargo movements 
	- E.g. At actin-microtubule intersections *in vitro*, cargoes can switch between these two tracks to continue traveling on the microtubule or switch to the actin filament. The switch is dependent on the number of motors of different kinds 
		- Cargo switching was found to depend on myosin V:dynein-dynactin force ratio 
![[Pasted image 20230402162709.png|375]]

## Cargo hitchhiking 
- Some cargoes can be transported by motor proteins indirectly via attachment to another cargo 
- E.g. Filamentous fungi mRNA and peroxisomes can be linked through large coiled coil proteins (e.g. PxdA) to vehicle cargo that is connected to a microtubule motor 
  ![[Pasted image 20230402162848.png|400]]

## Studying  motors
### Myosin drugs 
- Blebbistatin – binds cleft between upper and lower 50 kDa domain and stabilises ADP-Pi state, inhibiting release of Pi and preventing force generation 
- Halogenated pseudilins – bind at top of actin-binding cleft close to actin-binding region, inhibiting myosins of class I and IV 
- Omecamtiv mecarbil – binds at converter interface, which regulates lever arm swing. Activator for myosin II 
- CK-571 – inhibitor of smooth muscle myosin II and binds between converter region and relay helix 

### Microscopy
- In vitro assay 
- Attach motor to fluorescent marker e.g. GFP 

### Myosin interactions 
- **Y2H screens**
- **Co-IP**
- **GST pull down**. 
- **Proximity labelling using BirA** (see [[A1 Mass Spectrometry and Proteomics#^013483|proximity labelling]]) 
	- #experimental_evidence O' Loughlin et al (2018) – In-situ proximity labelling using BirA* identified novel MYO6 binding partners. E.g., BirA*-MYO6 no insert cargo binding domain localised to APPL1/Rab5-positive early endosomes, while BirA*-MYO6 large insert cargo binding domain localised to clathrin-coated structures. 
	- Secondary screening with new baits identified a broader MYo6 interactome (i.e. instead of using MYO6 as bait, use MYO6 interacting partner as bait)
- **BioID** allows for identification of isoform-specific interaction networks 
	- #experimental_evidence While both no insert and large insert MYO6 isoforms share 39 interactions, 16 were specific for large insert and 47 specific for no insert. Large insert associates with proteins in clathrin-coated vesicles such as AP2, SYNJ1 and PICALM
- **SILAC** can be used to study how different interaction partners bind to MYO6. 
	- #experimental_evidence Binding motifs for adaptor proteins and lipids (RRL, WWY, PIP2) were mutated and differences assessed in relative abundance of BirA*-MYO6 binding partners using SILAC. This identified 4 groups of MYO6-associated protein complexes that each interact with a different binding motif on MYO6 
	  ![[Pasted image 20230403151736.png|425]]

# Role of motor proteins in protein trafficking
- Integrating different cytoskeletal components and motor proteins together. 
- Dyneins and kinesin facilitate long distance transport along MTs, while myosins facilitate short-range transport along actin filaments
- Kinesin and dynein are faster, more processive than myosin 
[[C2 PTMs and Protein trafficking]]

## Endocytosis 
- Different endocytic pathways exist: clathrin-mediated endocytosis, caveolin-dependent uptake, phagocytosis, macropinocytosis 
- Different myosin motors are involved in each pathway

### Clathrin-mediated endocytosis 
![[Pasted image 20230403144708.png|375]]

#### Yeast
In yeast, myosin Is (myo3 and myo5) recruit actin nucleating activity to drive actin polymerisation 
1. Clathrin and WASP initiate endocytic site before actin polymerisation 
2. WASP-Myo3 activates Arp2/3 to promote actin assembly 
3. Elongation of pit invagination, powered by Myo5 
	1. Myo3 and 5 reorients actin filaments whose plus ends are blocked against the plasma membrane. This makes the plus ends accessible, allowing for actin network expansion. The growing network is coupled to the invagination tip, so that the clathrin coated pit can elongate 
	   ![[Pasted image 20230403144821.png|375]]
4. Myo5 and actin filaments drive fission of vesicle 

#### Mammals 
- In mammals, clathrin-mediated endocytosis occurs at the apical domain of polarised cells 
- The large insert isoform of MYO6 is involved in the transport of cargo (endocytic vesicle) down actin filaments – they have **reverse directionality** and transport cargo towards (-) end, which point towards interior of the cell (recall that actin filaments grow towards the outside of the cell, so (+) end points outwards)
	- Different splice variants of MYO6 are expressed differentially in different tissues. The large insert isoform is expressed in polarised cells with apical microvilli 
![[Pasted image 20230403150143.png|375]]
- MYO6 is recruited by Dab2 to clathrin-coated endocytic structures 
	- Dab2 binds to the NPxY internalisation signal in the cytoplasmic tail of receptors at the plasma membrane via its N-terminal phosphotyrosine (PTB) domain 
	- #experimental_evidence MYO6 KO mice show defects in apical endocytosis in kidney and intestinal epithelial cells 
- MYO6-Dab2 interaction regulates cargo processivity through the actin cortex 
	- #question don't get this part. Read Rai et al (2021) and Yu et al (2009)

## Transport of early endosomes 
- APPL1 endosomes align along actin filaments 
- MYO6 no insert isoform is involved in tethering APPL1/Rab5-positive early endosomes to the actin cortex, thus determining their position in the actin cortex 
- Position of endosomes underneath plasma membrane is important to their signalling function 
- #experimental_evidence An engineered MYO6+ isoform (contining MYO5 IQs) induces actin filament reorganisation and endosome clustering at the base of the filament 
	- Recall [[C3 Cytoskeleton and Organelle Movement#^1a9e3f]]
- MYO6 forms a tripartite complex with GIPC1 and LARG to drive actin reorganisation and regulate endosome positioning 
	- LARG is a Rho GEF and is activated by GPCR. It mediates actin remodelling by activating Rho, which in turn activates effectors that directly remodel actin. 

### Recycling pathway 
- MYO5b functions in fast recycling pathway from early endosomes to plasma membrane
- E.g. MYO5b and MYO5c are required for recycling of the transferrin receptor from the endocytic recycling compartment (ERC) back to the plasma membrane 

### Lysosomal pathway 
- Dynein is involved in movement of late endosomes to perinuclear region for receptor degradation in the lysosome (e.g. EGFR)
- Multiple plus-end directed microtubule motors (kinesin-1, -2, -3 and -13) are also associated with endo- and lysosomes 

## Organelle movement
E.g. melanosomes 
- Melanosomes are a specialised type of lysosome that provides tissues with color and photo-protection. They contain melanin pigment. 
- Model system for studying organelle motility 

### Melanosome transport is mediated by microtubule motors and myosin V  
**Fish melanophores**
- Melanosomes can cluster around the centre of the melanin-containing cell (around the nucleus), resulting in a light skin colour. Conversely, dispersal of melanosomes to the periphery results in a dark skin colour 
- Dispersion is activated by increase in cAMP, while melanosomes aggregate when cAMP levels fall 
- Aggregation requires retrograde movement involving dynein moving melanosomes towards the cell centre 
- Dispersion requires anterograde movement involving kinesin motor. Once melanosome reaches periphery, myosin V-dependent capture of melanosomes occurs at the cortical actin, so that melanosomes are retained at the periphery 
	- #experimental_evidence Treatment of melanophores with actin-stabilising drugs such as jasplakinolide selectively inhibits melanosome dispersion 

![[Pasted image 20230403153703.png|300]]

**Mammal melanocytes**
- In mammals, melanosomes are tethered to actin cytoskeleton at the periphery of the melanocyte, thentranslocated to adjacent keratinocytes 
- Actin tethering in mammals requires complex of myosin Va, melanophilin, Rab27a 
	- #experimental_evidence Identified in mice with coat colour mutations 

### Myosin V drives actin filament assembly to drive melanosome dispersal over long distances.
- Melanosomes themselves have actin filaments attached that other myosin V attached to their own melanosomes can walk along. This results in dispersal throughout the cell as melanosomes are transported in different directions. 
  ![[Pasted image 20230403154420.png|275]]
## Secretory pathway 
- Protein transport between the ER and Golgi is mediated by dynein and adaptor complex dynactin 
- Retrograde retrieval of proteins from ER involves kinesin-1 and kinesin-2 
- Cargo intended for secretion is delivered to plasma membrane using kinesin-1 
  ![[Pasted image 20230403154722.png|375]]
## Maintenance of organelle positioning 
### Golgi 
- Golgi complex is made up of stacks of cisternae connected by tubular membranes 
- Disruption of microtubules fragments Golgi, resulting in formation of mini-stacks 
- Depolymerisation of actin results in collapse of reticulate Golgi structure 
- Dynein and several kinesins and myosins are needed to maintain Golgi position and morphology 

### Endoplasmic reticulum 
- ER network aligns along microtubules
	- Disruption of microtubules collapses ER 
- ER tubules are moved towards the cell periphery via transport by kinesin-1 and via attachment of ER membranes to growing microtubule tips 
- ER network is also stabilised by myosin V, which may connect ER tubules to cortical actin and drive short-range movement 

## Exocytosis 
### Studying exocytosis
- Total internal reflection fluorescence microscopy (TIRF) can be used to visualise exocytic fusion events, as it only images the first 100-200 nm into the cell. This results in high resolution images of the cell surface (plasma membrane)

## Axonal transport and neurodegeneration 
### Huntingtin
- Huntingtin binds to dynein directly and via adaptor proteins to kinesin and myosin 
- Huntingtin phosphorylation switches vesicle transport in neurons from retrograde (dynein-driven) to anterograde (kinesin-driven)
- Loss of huntingtin results in a kinetic delay in ER to Golgi transport 
	- #experimental_evidence Cargo movement through exocytic pathway can be visualised under a microscope by blocking GFP-tagged cargo (e.g. human growth hormone) from leaving the ER, then lifting the block to result in a synchronous pulse of cargo leaving the ER. The block is created by attaching an aggregation domain to the cargo, which causes aggregation such that it is too big to leave the ER. The block is lifted by treating with a small molecule that blocks the aggregation domains 
	- Rate of transport from ER to Golgi was then measured. Golgi was labelled using GalT-RFP; GalT is resident in the Golgi. 
	- Loss of HTT (via RNAi) was found to delay transport of cargo from ER to Golgi 
- Huntingtin is required for secretory vesicle fusion at the plasma membrane
	- #experimental_evidence TIRF microscopy used to quantify total number of fusion events in live cells. siRNA KD of huntingtin reduced the number of exocytic vesicles fusing with PM 

## Axonal transport
- Neurons are large polarised cells that require active transport between the cell body and the cell periphery. This is challenging because of the long axon that separates the cell body and periphery by a great distance. 
- Anterograde axonal transport occurs via kinesins, while retrograde transport is mediated by dyneins along microtubules. 
- Cargoes move in saltatory fashion, i.e. with rapid movements, pauses, and directional switches 
	- While moving, cargoes move about the same velocity, but the overall velocity is controlled by the time spent pausing; some cargoes spend >70% of time pausing, resulting in slower transport. 
- Membrane-bound organelles undergo fast axonal transport while cytoplasmic proteins and cytoskeletal proteins undergo slow axonal transport 

### Fast axonal transport 
- Different membrane compartments and protein complexes are transported along MT tracks in either anterograde or retrograde direction

### Axonal microtubule organisation 
- Axonal initiation segment (AIS) acts as a barrier between cell body and axon, maintaining "plus end out" polarity of microtubules 
	- In AIS, microtubules are crosslinked via TRIM45 and MTCL1, and tethered to plasma membrane through aknyrin G 
	- Minus end of microtubules are stabilised by CAMSAP2 and acentrosomal nucleation involves gamma-tubulin ring complex 
- Tau and MAP6 stabilise axonal microtubules 

![[Pasted image 20230403161443.png|475]]
### Mitochondria movement 
- Mitochondria are transported along axon to control ATP production and cytsolic Ca2+ 
- Mitochondria undergo bidirectional transport, with anterograde mediated by kinesin-1 and kinesin-3, while retrograde is mediated by dynein 
	- #experimental_evidence Mutations in kinesin-1 (KIF5A) causes hereditary spastic paraplegias. In kinesin-1 KO motor neurons, velocity of mitochondrial transport in both directions is reduced 
- Several myosin motors are required for mitochondria positioning in different cell types e.g. at synapse 
- Miro 1/2 in the outer mitochondrial membrane recruits the adaptor protein TRAK, which in turn recruits dynein or kinesin 
- Ca2+ binding to Miro arrests microtubule-dependent transport 
- Miro1/2 can also bind to MYO19 (on actin) to coordinate microtubule and actin-dependent transport 
![[Pasted image 20230403161726.png|350]]
### Autophagosome movement 
- In autophagy, autophagosomes deliver damaged organelles, protein aggregates and other cytosolic components to the lysosome for degradation 
- In neurons, material in the axon tip intended for degradation are loaded into autophagosomes, which are then transported retrograde towards the cell body for degradation by dynein motors
	- Autophagosomes are bound to both kinesin and dynein motors, so kinesin activity is actually inhibited to allow dynein-driven retrograde movement 
  ![[Pasted image 20230403162043.png|500]]
- Dynein regulates the spatial distribution of autophagosomes in neurons
	- In primary neurons, autophagosomes are formed in the distal axon and mature while moving processively along the axon towards the cel body 
	  ![[Pasted image 20230403162308.png|450]]
### Mutations in components involved in axonal transport result in neurodegeneration 
- Chargot-Marie tooth (CMT) disease is caused by mutation in kinesin-3
	- Kinesin-3 transports synaptic vesicle precursors to axon terminal 
	- Q98L mutation in P loop of ATP binding site causes loss of motor activity in vivo, and inhibition of mobility towards plus ends of microtubules 
- Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) is linked to mutations in annexin A11 
	- Annexin A11 tethers RNA granules to lysosomes for long-distance transport along the axon (cargo hitchhiking)
	- N-terminal low complexity (disordered) domain of Annexin A11 facilitates its phase separation into membraneless RNA granules, while C-terminal membrane binding domain enables interactions with lysosomes 
	  ![[Pasted image 20230403162626.png|275]]
- Alzheimer's disease patients have impaired axonal transport 
	- Hyperphosphorylation of mAP tau by CDK5-p25 kinase or GSK3beta reduces affinity of tau for MT, resulting in destabilisation of MT track 
	- Mutant Abeta, tau, and PS1 proteins cause aberrant phosphorylation of kinesin and dynein motors, leading to cargo release from motors

	- Consider if cell lines are representative of the *in vivo* situation... 
		- Media often contains growth factors 
	- 3D environment would be ideal for measuring mechanics  (rather than cells on glass plates)
	- Using a native setting as far as possible will help with representativeness! 
- Different cell types – different cells have different cytoskeleton architecture e.g. neurons vs microvili 

# Signalling architecture 
- Signal inputs – extrinsic or intrinsic
	- Developmental programmes 
	- How is PIP2 signal generated to signal to actin 
	- Receptor 
- Rho GTPases as central integrators
	- GAPs and GEFs
	- Interactions with each other 
	- Dominant negative mutations 
- Effectors 
	- Relief of autoinhibition
		- Actin polymerises easily so it has to be highly repressed in the cell to control cytoskeleton formation
	- Different complement of effectors -> Different architectures
	- How do these complement of effectors change over time, context.
	- Integrins, cadherins
- Synaphotrophic hypothesis
