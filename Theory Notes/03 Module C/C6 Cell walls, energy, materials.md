# Sugar bioeconomy
- Biomass carbon in vascular land plants is the only renewable carbon source with **size potential** to replace all fossil carbon used for fuels, plastics, alcohols
- Plant carbon can come from sucrose (e.g. sugar cane, beet), starch (e.g. maize, wheat), lignocellulose (e.g. wood, paper, straw, bagasse, household waste)
- Nanocellulose (~Glu<sub>200</sub>) can be made into a variety of products (e.g. packaging, textiles, hydrogels, food ingredients)
	- E.g. ioncell.fi developed an ionic solution that solubilises cellulose into individual fibres that can then be spun into textiles 
## Challenges 
- Use of crop residues may have negative environmental impact 
- Ploughing pasture for agriculture releases carbon 
- Not cost effective in some places 
	- Cost and transport of raw material e.g. straw is not dense, 70% water. Cheaper if use residues *already* at sugar mill, e.g. corn grain fibre, sugar cane bagasse 
- Dirty, heterogenous material 
- Lignin is not a high value product, with few applications 
- Producing ethanol on its own from lignocellulose is not cost-effective
	- Cellulosic ethanol industry has not become cost competitive with petroleum 
- Cell wall heterogeneity increases enzyme mixture complexity
	- Cell wall composition differs between species feedstocks. While relative amounts of cellulose, hemicellulose, and lignin vary only slightly, the types of hemicelluloses vary substantially – e.g. eudicots have more xylan, while gymnosperms have high glucomannan. This means different species feedstocks require different enzyme mixtures for optimal digestion, so refineries may have to focus on specific feedstocks 
- Cell wall structure reduces digestibility (recalcitrance)
	- Cell wall polysaccharides interactions limit access to activity of water, enzymes
### Plant cell walls are recalcitrant to enzymatic digestion 
- Recalcitrance = difficulty in digestion 
- Plant cell wall is a semi-crystalline polysaccharide-rich material
- Polysaccharides exist in varying degrees of crystallinity
	- Cellulose is composed of crystalline regions and crystal defects; fibril surfaces are different to each other
	- Hemicelluloses are non-crystalline individual chains 
	- Hemicelluloses bound to cellulose are semi-crystalline, existing as a flat surface 
- Crystallinity protects cell wall from enzyme activity (recalcitrance), but this is a challenge for bioprocessing 
- Other crystalline polysaccharides exist e.g. chitin, starch 
## First generation biofuels 
- Based on sugars, vegetable oils e.g. sucrose, starch, oils
- UK-E10 will be standard petrol from 2021 (10% ethanol)
- Better CO<sub>2</sub> and energy balance than fossil fuels
### Requirements for success of first gen biofuels
**Brazil** 
- Maturity of technology – ethanol fermentation from sucrose is well developed as a technology 
- High plant productivity – due to high temperature, humidity
- High yields – sucrose from sugarcane can be produced at ~15 tonnes/Ha, and after fermentation, ~10 000L ethanol/Ha 
- Economic viability – supported by fossil fuel tax 
- Does not compete with food use of land or forest – in Brazil, just 1% area of Brazil used for sugar cane for fuel, which is 4% of agricultural area; land used was previously cleared and is far from Amazon 
### Limitations
- However, may compete with food use and divert land from food production
- Variable net energy and CO<sub>2</sub> balance e.g. diesel may be used in faming 
### Areas for improvement
- Increasing yields of sugar
- "Second generation" biofuels – Using other crop residues (e.g. bagasse, leaves) for ethanol 
	- Breed for "energy cane" which has higher biomass yield overall, rather than just high sucrose content (e.g. Granbio)
- Engineering enzymes to improve fermentation process e.g. low temperature amylases 
## Second generation biofuels
- Based on lignocellulose 
- Fermentation of sugars derived from cellulose, xylans to produce ethanol or butanol 
- E.g. use of sugar cane bagasse and straw in Brazil/Africa/India; grain fibre for ethanol in US
### Requirements for success
- Net energy yield 
- Net greenhouse gas reductions 
- Not compete with land, water resources for food
- At scale to replace with fossil fuels 
- Replace fossil fuels only where electrification is not feasible (rather than all transport fuels, which is difficult)
- Higher value products are needed to make lignocellulosic fuels economic e.g. advanced fuels, plastics, high-value polymer products
- Optimising recovery of glucose, xylose from biomass particles 

### Biofuel processing

id1(biomass)
id2(pre-treatment)
id3(enzymatic treatment)
id4(fermentation)
id5(distillation)
id1-->id2-->id3-->id4-->id5
```
- Biomass = cell wall
- Pre-treatment = subject biomass to high temperature
- Enzymatic treatment = Breakdown biomass with cellulase, xylanase, LPMO enzymes at large scale (tonnes)
- Fermentation = C6, C5 sugars fermented with genetically modified yeast 

> [!NOTE] Improving processing
> Each step of biofuel processing can be facilitated by biotechnology. 
> - Biomass -> [[C6 Cell walls, energy, materials#Engineering cell walls for biorefining|Engineer cell walls]] that are less recalcitrant and require less pre-treatment without compromising plant growth (i.e. biomass yield)
> - Enzymatic treatment -> [[C6 Cell walls, energy, materials#Engineering CAZymes|Engineer enzymes]] that are more efficient, thermostable, pH stable 
> - Fermentation -> engineer yeast that have higher fermentation yields, engineer cell walls to have more easily fermentable sugars (C6)

### Advantages
- Yield is higher per hectare than food crops as most plant biomass is in cell walls
- Use of crop residues from food production can avoid land use change – if both sucrose and lignocellulose residues are used for energy, can increase energy yield without increasing land usage 
- More environmentally benign than food production agriculture, in terms of: less fertiliser and pesticide usage, mixed species use, late-harvest supporting biodiversity 
- GHG balance better than fossil fuels

## General composition

- Enzymes – to modify polysaccharides 
- Lignin
- cellulose
- Pectins
- Hemicelluloses 
## Architecture

> ![[Pasted image 20230525120736.png]]

## Synthesis
- Polysaccharides are synthesised by glycosyltransferases from sugar nucleotides. Most are linked to UDP, but mannose is linked to GDP 
- Sugar nucleotide precursors are made in cytosol and in Golgi lumen, polymerised in Golgi to form cell wall polysaccharides 
- Most sugar nucleotides are synthesised from UDP-Glc which is then modified into other monosaccharides  
- Specific membrane transporters then allow passage of sugar nucleotides into Golgi lumen (rate of transport is a point of regulation of polysaccharide synthesis)
![[Pasted image 20230127113058.png|450]]
### Salvage pathway 
- Remodeling of cell wall polysaccharides results in release of sugars into the wall, which can be reused by converting them back into sugar nucleotides 
- Sugars are first phosphorylated by a C1 kinase (Sugar + ATP -> Sugar-1-P + ADP), then pyrophosphorylase generates the UDP sugar (Sugar-1-P + UTP -> Sugar-UDP + PPi). 
	- This can be useful for radiolabelling of sugars. 
## Studies on polysaccharide localisation
- Autoradiography
- Antibodies against plant glycans
- Tagged proteins
- *In vitro* assays – fractionation of membranes and measurement of enzymatic activity 
- *Arabidopsis* model system 
## Extensins 
- Structural plant cell wall proteins
- Build a scaffold for deposition of other polysaccharides 
- Hydroxyproline-rich, with SPPPP motif. ProOH synthesised in ER from proline by prolyl-4-hydroxylase 
- Extensins are modified with arabinose, galactose by Golgi GTs, and these glycosylations are important to function 
	- EXT3/RSH forms a self assembling network
		- #experimental_evidence Cannon et al (2008) – atomic force microscopy imaging 
- Staggered alignment of extensins allow tyrosines to align and crosslink covalently with extensin peroxidase
	- #experimental_evidence Cannon et al (2008) – Control protein containing 20 tandem repeats of arabinosylated extensin sequence (SO<sub>4</sub>SOSO<sub>4</sub>YYYK) cannot align staggered with Tyr crosslinks
## Arabinogalactan functions 
- Highly glycosylated proteoglycans 
- Glycan structure is unclear but may be β(1-3) galactan, branched with β(1-6) galactan, as well as terminal arabinose and glucuronic acid. Glycans are added by GTs. 
- GPI-anchored to plasma membrane 
- Performs various functions 
	- Bind and release calcium in pH dependent process in signaling processes
	- Stabilise surface proteins and influence interactions
	- Aid solubility of hydrophobic cell wall components (emulsifier)
![[Pasted image 20230127114411.png|600]]
## Lignin 
### Functions
- Fills void in cell wall 
- Excludes water 
- Increases strength 
### Synthesis
- Polyphenolic ultimately synthesised from phenylalanine via phenylpropanoid pathway 
- Three main monolignols can be incorporated into the polymer. Mostly S and G units are found in eudicots, but mostly G in gymnosperms. Each monolignol has different structure which confers different properties. 
![[Pasted image 20230127114848.png|350]]
- Monolignols are transported out across the plasma membrane, probably by ABC transporters, and monolignol phenol is oxidised to a radical by laccases and/or perxodiases, which then link up via radical coupling in various combinatorial ways. As a result, lignin is highly heterogenous 
	- Lignin composition is thus determined by relative proportions of exported monolignols and other aromatics 
- Synthesis occurs after deposition of polysaccharides in cell wall 
- Monolignols secreted by one cell can be used by adjacent cells to synthesis lignin 
- Synthesis of lignin is very flexible – variants of the classic H, G, S units have been observed e.g. caffeyl alcohol instead of coniferyl alcohol in C-lignin of seed coats in vanilla bean 
### Lignin modification can improve fermentable sugar yields for biofuel production 
- Wilkerson et al (2014) – Created poplar trees with alkali-labile lignin by incorporating ester bonds into lignin ("Zip lignin") 
- Chen & Dixon (2007)
## Pectin 
- Class of polysaccharides easily extracted with hot water 
- Made up of charged sugars, e.g. polygalacturonan, rhamnogalacturonan I and II, arabinan
- Pectin can form gels, with gel pore size depending on `[`Ca<sup>2+</sup>`]`, methyl-esterification (neutralises negative charges), side-chain length 
	- Adding acid can hydrolyse esters (e.g. lemon juice)
- Ca<sup>2+</sup> is bound to gel in an "egg box" conformation 
## Cellulose
### Structure
- β-1,4-glycan chains with two-fold screw structure (i.e. alternating residues are inverted with respect to each other), and the OH groups are equatorial, resulting in a flat structure as well as interchain and intrachain hydrogen bonding. Apart from the interchain H bonds, London dispersion forces between parallel chains also strengthen the interactions (and may contribute more to the strength of interaction). 
- Interchain interactions forms microfibrils, which are packed in a crystalline order 
- Are there amorphous regions in cellulose microfibrils? 
	- Acid hydrolysis releases small regular sizes crystallites (CNC), but caused by crystal defects? 
	- #structural_evidence  Cryo-EM shows no regular amorphous regions 
- Cellulose has two natural crystalline allomorphs, Iα and Iβ, with Iβ being the predominant form in plants
	- Iα – all chains are identical crystallographically, but alternating glucose units in each chain differ slightly in conformation. Found in bacteria. 
	- Iβ – chains of two distinct kinds are arranged in alternating sheets. 
- Glucose residues in fibrils are in different environments, which may be caused by different interactions with other residues, water, etc.  ^1f1359
	-  #structural_evidence  Solid state NMR 
- There are likely to be 18 chains in one cellulose microfibril
	- #experimental_evidence Yang & Kubicki (2020) propose that there are 18 chains in cellulose fibril, with 234432 conformation preferred based on quantum mechanical calculations 
	- #experimental_evidence This would be consistent with the fact that freeze-fracture TEM experiments show six-lobed CSCs in native membranes, with each subunit containing three CesAs, so there are 18 CesAs per rosette. If each make 1 cellulose chain, then the microfibril could contain 18 chains
	- #experimental_evidence AFM imaging of CMF shape by Song et al (2020) also supports 234432 model 
- However, some researchers believe there are 36 chains based on evidence from X-ray analysis and solid state NMR which estimate diameters larger than can be accommodated by 18 chains 
	- Maybe there is heterogeneity in CMF structures in different plant cell walls? 
- The exact packing of the chains within the microfibril determines the extent of the hydrophilic and hydrophobic surfaces of the microfibril 
	- These surfaces interact differently with water, other celluloses, hemicelluloses and cellulose-binding proteins, so the exact packing is important in regulating cell wall assembly 
### Organisation of microfibrils in cell wall 
- In primary cell walls, microfibrils aggregate as 2D networks of bundled microfibrils, while in secondary cell walls the cellulose forms a 3D network of microfibril aggregates (macrofibrils)
- The difference may be due to differences in initial microfibril deposition at the cell surface (which is guided by [[C6 Cell walls, energy, materials#CSC dynamics|CSC dynamics]]), as well as the presence of different matrix polysaccharides (e.g. hemicelluloses, pectin) that regulate how cellulose assembles
- Extracellular proteins e.g. COBRA-LIKE family, chitinase-like proteins could also affect cellulose patterning, as mutation in these genes results in abnormal cellulose organisation. Mechanism of action unclear. 
### Synthesis 
- Cellulose synthesised at plasma membrane
- Cellulose fibres emerge from cellulose synthase complex (CSC) "rosettes", fibres are linked to microtubules 
- Synthesis is processive and does not require a primer 
	- #structural_evidence Morgan et al (2013) used X-ray crystallography to obtain the structure of a cellulose synthase from *Rhodobacter* 
	- #structural_evidence Sethaphong et al (2013) – De novo and homology modeling of catalytic domain of cotton cellulose synthase shows agreement with *Rhodobacter* structure 
#### CSC dynamics 
- Microtubules guide the direction of CSC movement, thus guiding the orientation of the cellulose microfibrils
	- #experimental_evidence  Xin et al (2020) – *Arabidopsis* mutant defective in cellulose synthase interactive-1 (which links CSC to microtubules) has improved microfibril alignment. In addition, treatment of the plant with oryzalin, a MT depolymeriser, results in more parallel microfibril organisation 
- Pre-existing microfibrils may also guide CSC movement 
	- #experimental_evidence Chan and Coen (2020) observed via microscopy studies that autonomous CSCs (not guided by MTs) change direction of motion along cell surface when they encountered the trail of another CSC, and tracked along it 
		- Hypothesised that nascent CMF binds to a pre-existing microfibril 
#### CesA proteins
- GT2 family, homologous to bacterial cellulose synthesis enzymes
- Membrane-spanning with 7 TMDs to make a channel for glucan 
- *Arabidopsis* has 10 CesA genes that may specialise in different functions, e.g. synthesis cellulose in primary cell wall, secondary cell wall, only synthesise in certain cells, etc
	- #experimental_evidence Secondary cell wall mutants for CesA are weaker, suggesting that cellulose is important for wall strength 
	- #experimental_evidence Primary cell wall *cesA*mutants are dwarfed due to lower cell wall integrity and stress signalling response 
- GT2s make beta linkages from alpha-linked UDP-Glc precursors – "inverting"
	- UDP-α-Glc is the donor
- Works as trimeric complexes composed of 3 CesA polypeptides, which may be all identical or different (there are 10 different CesA). Not understood how complex is determined. 
	- #structural_evidence Purushotham et al (2020) – Cryo-EM structure of poplar CesA8 trimer expressed in insect cells. Catalytic domain of CesA8 is very similar to bacterial cellulose synthase, and CesA8 trimerise via TM7 intercalating into neighbour subunit. Cellulose was seen in tunnel through the trimer. 
#### Cellulose fibril formation 
- Trimer forms three chains at most. A hypothesis is that three chains may coalesce into a protofibril. With 6 trimers in a rosette, the 6 protofibrils coalesce into 18 chain elementary fibril 
- The 234432 habit determined by Yang & Kubicki (2020) habit fits the structure of CSC best 
## Hemicellulose
### Structure
- β-1,4-linked neutral sugars
### Synthesis
- Cellulose synthase-like enzymes (CSLs)
### Interaction with cellulose 
- Hemicelluloses partially coat cellulose microfibrils 
- May modulate interactions between cellulose fibrils. At hot spots of cellulose interactions, hemicellulose can affect interactions 
- Hemicellulose may act to bring two microfibril surfaces together
- Hemicellulose can also sterically hinder contact between CMF surfaces 
	- #experimental_evidence Cellulose is better aligned in outer epidermal wall of *Arabidopsis* mutant without xyloglucan (Xiao et al 2016
- E.g. Cellulose is disorganised in mutants lacking both XyG and β-GGM 
	- #experimental_evidence Yu et al (2022)
- E.g. cellulose-glucomannan interaction is important for mucilage adherence to cellulose rays in *Arabidopsis*
	- #experimental_evidence Yu et al (2018), Yu et al (2022)

### Glucomannan 
- Mannan and glucose in backbone, occasional galactose side chains
- Patterned structure of β-GGM may be important in interactions? 
- Made by CSLAs
- Functions of glucomannan 
	- Involved in hypocotyl cell expansion
	- Essential for development in *Arabidopsis*
		- *CLSA7* impairs pollen function
- Phylogenetic distribution 
	- Main hemicellulose in Charophytes
	- Galactoglucomannans are major components of secondary cell walls in gymnosperms 
	- Mannans abundant in mosses, lycophytes
	- Mannans, glucomannans less abundant in spermatophytes; function likely replaced by other hemicelluloses 
		- β-GGM in primary cell wall of *Arabidopsis* 
- Mannan is more challenging to study because it is not as abundant in dicots
	- Pine trees could be a model species, but we can't genetically engineer and grow it in the same way as *Arabidopsis*
	- Maybe use mosses? Have lots of mannan 

### Xylan
#### Phylogenetic distribution of xylan 
- Major hemicellulose in eudicot secondary walls and in all grass walls, and is substantial in gymnosperms 
#### Structure
- β-1,4-linked xylose, which is structurally the same (equatorial OH) but is a pentose 
- In solution, forms a 3-fold screw which is a flexible conformation, as it lacks enough H-bonds to keep it flat, unlike cellulose glucan. But can also form 2-fold screw ^8b723a
	- #structural_evidence Simmons et al (2016) – <sup>13</sup>C solid state NMR shows xylan present in two conformations 
	- 2-fold screw xylan is dependent on celullose
		- #structural_evidence  Simmons et al (2016) – Missing in cellulose deficient mutant *irx3* 
- Xylans are always substituted ("decorations")
	- #question Why? 
	- Performs various functions, including
		- Maintain xylan solubility
		- Reduce digestibility – impedes xylan backbone recognition by enzymes from pathogens e.g. fungi 
		- Influence cell wall architecture – decorations may influence binding to cellulose, lignin 
		- Covalently link xylan to lignin e.g. in grass, xylan has ferloylated arabinose ester, and feruloylation links xylan to lignin through the ester 
	- Even pattern of decoration important for binding to cellulose hydrophilic surfaces, while binding on hydrophobic surfaces does not require the pattern, but may involve flat ribbons of xylan 
		- #structural_evidence Molecular dynamics 
	- Engineering of xylan patterning could influence cell wall architecture 
	- Need more investigation into cell wall properties conferred by a xylan shell on cellulose fibrils. 
#### Function 
- Most xylan is bound to cellulose surface in woody tissues, with most xylan in 2-fold screw conformation, and most cellulose hydrophilic surfaces are coated with xylan 
#### Synthesis
- Co-expression of enzymes in secondary wall synthesis allows for identification of xylan biosynthetic enzymes
- 3 classes of Arabidopsis Golgi GTs are involved in xylan backbone synthesis – IRX9/9L, 10/10L, 14/14L, all three classes are needed for xylan synthesis, but each pair (e.g. 9/9L) is partially redundant 
	- IRX9L/10L specialised for primary cell wall xylan synthesis 
	- IRX10 and 10L have xylosyltransferae activity in vitro stimulated by IRX9/14, i.e. can extend xylan backbone 
- Other enzymes are involved in xylan chain reducing end synthesis (e.g. IRX7, IRX8), xylan glucuronosyltransferase (GUX), xylan methyltransferase (GXM), xylan arabinosyltransferases (XAT), acetyltransferases (e.g. TBL29, ESK, XOAT1)
- Transport proteins for import of UDP-xylose, UDP-GlcA, UDP-Araf, S-adenosyl methionine and AcetylCoa into Golgi lumen 
- GT61 mediates arabinosyl tranfer onto xylan in grasses 
	- Anders et al (2012) – RNAi of wheat endosperm reduces Ara on wheat-flour xylan 
- Xax1 adds xylose side chains to Ara side chain 
- XynC requires specific spacing of decorations on glucan
### Xyloglucan 
#### Phylogenetic distribution
- Most abundant hemicellulose in primary walls of spermatophytes, except for grasses
- In mosses and liverworts, xyloglucan has charged sidechains, while in vascular plants, the sidechains are neutral 
#### Structure 
- Beta-(1,4)-glucan backbone with xylose attached to carbon-6 (XXGG or XXXG pattern)
- Some xylosyl residues are galactosylated (2nd or 3rd X)
- Sidechains are diverse – how variation affects xyloglucan function is unclear  
	- The specific sidechains can be changed without effect on phenotype of the plant, so perhaps that explains the diversity, in that there is no regulation on the type of sidechain? 
	- Sidechains may also help to keep XyG soluble 
		- #experimental_evidence Kong et al (2015) – *Arabidopsis* mutants deficient in XyG galactosylation had dwarf phenotype, but this was rescued when xyloglucan was removed entirely via genetic deletion. So dysfunctional xyloglucan has a negative effect, perhaps due to aggregation in the Golgi? 
#### Interaction with cellulose 
- Via hydrogen bonding, dispersion forces, hydrophobic effects 
- We do not understand how secretion of cellulose, xyloglucan at cell surface is coordinated and how this contributes to cell wall assembly 
- Xyloglucan may interact with cellulose via a two-phase kinetic model where xyloglucan binds to cellulose in a coiled configuration, then rearranges itself into a flatter shape
	- #experimental_evidence Villares et al (2015) measured the adsorption of xyloglucan onto CNFs via quartz crystal microbalance
- Sidechains also regulate how xyloglucan binds to cellulose *in vitro*, but #experimental_evidence  *in vivo* no difference in binding was observed in a *mur3* mutant that lacks galactosyltransferase for third X in XXXG 
- In the cell wall, xyloglucan appears to have both extended (bound to cellulose) and swollen random coil (solvated) conformations 
	- #experimental_evidence Zheng et al (2018) did field-emission scanning electron microscopy (FESEM) on onion epidermal walls with Carbohydrate Binding Module 76 (CBM76) conjugated to nanogold. 
- Traditionally, the interaction between XyG and cellulose has been hypothesised to follow a "tethering model"
	- #experimental_evidence However, Cavalier et al (2008) showed that genetic deletion of xyloglucan in *Arabidopsis* *xxt1 xxt2* only had minor effects on plant phenotype; only root hairs were short and malformed (Although this could be an argument that XyGs are important in some tissues...)
	- #experimental_evidence Cosgrove and colleagues also tested the tethering model by digesting isolated cells walls with xyloglucanase, then tested the effect on cell wall mechanics. They found that digestion did not have a biomechanical effect on cell walls from various plant species.
- Instead, a more recent "biomechanical hotspot" model has been proposed by Cosgrove, where XyG only binds at particular junctions to CMF 
	- #experimental_evidence When cell walls were digesting with a bifunctional endoglucanase that digests xyloglucan and disordered cellulose (e.g. Cel12A from *Trichoderma reesei*), the biomechanical properties of the cell walls changed, e.g. increasing axial compliance, extension of walls held at a constant force

# Engineering cell walls for biorefining 
## Aims 
- Plant biomass is predominantly made up of the cell wall 
- In second generation biofuel production, need to optimise recovery of glucose and xylose from biomass, which is then fermented to produce ethanol and butanol 

> [!important] What is recalcitrance?
> [[CarpitaMcCann_2020]] define recalcitrance to be "features of biomass that increase energy requirements, cost, and/or complexity in conversion processes, and/or reduce recovery of biomass carbon into desired products"

## Challenges in engineering 
- Engineer cell walls with architecture that are easily deconstructed for biorefining, and at the same time have minimal trade-offs in biomass quality and yield 
	- Target expression in tissues where the cell wall component is non-essential (e.g. fiber cells)
	- Target expression in developmental stages where component is not essential for growth (e.g. senescence)
- Limit side effect of manipulating lignin on production of phenylpropanoid-derived secondary metabolites for use in other physiological functions e.g. biotic stress resistance 
- We don't have enough information on cell wall biosynthesis, including how the individual polysaccharides are integrated into the cell wall. If we can understand this, we can manipulate cell wall biosynthesis to generate less recalcitrant architectures 
- We also don't have enough information to know how manipulating biosynthetic enzymes will affect the abundance of each cell wall polymer (i.e. the metabolic flux aspect)
- We don't know enough about how the cell wall synthesis is regulated, leading to unexpected consequences when biosynthetic genes are manipulated (e.g. Joshi et al 2011)
- We have to be careful about the translatability of findings in *Arabidopsis* to other plant species, as they can sometimes differ 
	- Particularly for crop species, it is not clear if engineering the crops in the same way as the model species used would affect their growth in the field, which has different conditions from in controlled growth rooms. 
- Combining engineering targets in a single plant can also be technically challenging – need to look for epistatic effects 

## General techniques 
- Omics 
	- [[C6 Cell walls, energy, materials#Discovery of novel enzyme activities|Discover novel enzyme activities]]
	- Determine how biosynthesis of cell wall components is regulated
		- Identify promoters with desirable expression profiles, e.g. for tissue-specific or developmental stage-specific expression of transgenes 

## Cellulose 
- Cellulose is composed of glucose, a hexose, so it is fermentable by yeast. Increasing cellulose proportion compared to pentose-based polysaccharides (e.g. xylan) can improve ethanol yields 

### Modifying cellulose content in cell walls 
- Increasing cellulose content 
	- #experimental_evidence Overexpression of sucrose synthase in poplar leads to increased UDP-glucose production for cellulose synthesis. By using secondary cell wall-specific promoters, cellulose abundance increased without affecting plant growth 
	- #experimental_evidence Overexpression of UDP-glucose pyrophosphorylase, which produces UDP-glucose, in Jute increased its cellulose content 
	- However, not all biosynthetic enzymes can be overexpressed in this way to improve cellulose content 
		- #experimental_evidence Joshi et al (2011) – Overexpression of CesAs in polar did not lead to cellulose accumulation, but rather reduced cellulose because the endogenous CesAs were silenced! Instead the plants had aberrant, pleiotropic phenotypes. 
			- Shows that understanding of regulatory networks governing cell wall synthesis are also important to engineering cell walls. 

## Lignin 
### Challenge for biorefining
- Contributes disproportionately to harvested biomass 
- Strong interactions between lignin and cellulose contributes to recalcitrance by limiting access of saccharifying enzymes to polysaccharides 
### Modifying lignin content in cell walls 
- Disrupt monolignol synthesis
	- #experimental_evidence In poplar, disruption of genes encoding enzymes involved in monolignol synthesis (e.g. C4H, 4CL, Cinnamate 3'-hydroxylase, CCR) decreased lignin content and increased saccharification yields 
	- #experimental_evidence Downregulation of *CAD* to block conversion to monolignol only had a modest reduction of lignin in poplar, but improved saccharification yields 
	- However, manipulation of these genes can reduce biomass yield, which may be due to incomplete xylem stiffening such that it collapses more easily under water stress 
- Disrupt monolignol synthesis in a tissue-specific manner 
	- #experimental_evidence Smith et al (2013) expressed an miRNA against cinnamoyl-CoA reductase under the control of the secondary cell wall cellulose synthase promoter. This reduced lignin content in interfascular fibers, while not affecting vessel walls. 
	- #experimental_evidence Yang et al (2013) – Swapping the promoter for the Arabidopsis cinnamate 4-hydroxylase (C4H) enzyme with a vessel-specific promoter restricts C4H expression to vessel cells, while reducing lignin content in cell walls of other cell types e.g. fiber cells. This reduced overall lignin content while not compromising plant growth. 
- Change lignin composition by genetic manipulation of biosynthetic enzymes 
	- #experimental_evidence Overexpressing *F5H* in poplar produced lignin enriched in S units. This improved glucose and xylose yield without affecting the growth of the tree 
		- High S lignin variants have higher saccharification yields in catalytic lignin decomposition treatments, possibly due to better fiber cell separation, which increases accessibility of cellulases or chemical catalysts 
	- Enrich for H units in lignin which reduces degree of polymerisation, thus reducing recalcitrance #experimental_evidence Repressing activity of *p*-coumaroyl-shikimate 3' hydroxylase (C3'H) in *Arabidopsis* defective in two mediator-encoding genes resulted in lignin with 95% H units, without compromising plant growth by much. 
		- This approach may be difficult to due in crops as many genes need to be repressed in specific tissues 
	- #experimental_evidence Overexpression of 4-O-methyltransferase gene in poplar resulted in formation of 4-O-methyl coniferyl and sinapyl alcohols which terminate lignin polymerisation. This reduced lignin content, increasing saccharification yield 
	- Introducing ferulate esters into lignin allows it to be fragmented into smaller oligomers, as the esters are easily cleaved by mild alkali treatment. #experimental_evidence Wilkerson et al (2014) accomplished this in poplar by expressing feruloyl-CoA monolignol transferase under the control of a secondary cell wall cellulose synthase promoter 
	- #experimental_evidence Eudes et al (2015) – heterologous expression of 3-dehydroshikimate dehydratase from *Corynebacterium glutamicum* in the plastids of *Arabidopsis* results in conversion of 3-dehydroshikimate into protocatechuate. As 3-dehydroshikimate is an intermediate for the shikimate pathway, this reduces the availability of shikimate, an important metabolite in the lignin synthesis pathway. 
- Overcoming regulatory effects of modifying phenylpropanoid pathway 
	- #experimental_evidence Mutation in C3'H in *Arabidopsis* blocks formation of G unit so that only H unit is produced. This resulted in dwarfism. A second mutation in the transcriptional repressor *Mediator5* rescued the growth and accumulation of H lignin. 
- Improve iron accumulation during treatments – ferrous iron can be added to biomass to improve separation of cellulose microfibril aggregates
	- #experimental_evidence Expression of a fusion protein of iron binding peptides to a carbohydrate-binding module in *Arabidopsis* and rice increased iron accumulation, improving saccharification yield 
- Site-selective delivery of metal catalysts makes the cell wall more amenable to catalytic decomposition, increasing surface area for catalysis 
### Application in biorefining 
- Lignin can be used as a source of aromatic molecules 

## Pectin 
### Challenges for biorefining 
- Pectin is a matrix polysaccharide that can block access of enzymes to other polysaccharides 

### Modifying pectin in cell walls 
- Digest pectin with enzymes 
	- #experimental_evidence Expression of a pectate lyase from *Pectobacterium carotovorum* during senescence in *Arabidopsis* improved saccharification. By expressing it only during senescence, the enzyme is only expressed in late stages of the plant life cycle, thus not affecting plant growth and development. 
	- Expression of *Arabidopsis* gene encoding rhamnogalacturonan-I lyase in polar disrupted cell-cell adhesion via middle lamella, which helped to reduce particle size upon grinding and improve saccharification yield without reducing biomass yield. This reduces the energy needed for breaking down the biomass.  
- Block pectin synthesis
	- #experimental_evidence Biswal et al (2018) used RNAi to reduce the expression of the pectin biosynthesis enzyme, galacturonosyltransferase 4, in switchgrass and poplar. This improved biomass yield and saccharification yield from hot water treatment and enzymatic hydrolysis. 
- Increase hexose/pentose ratio by increasing beta-1,4-galactan sidechains on rhamnogalacturonan I 
	- #experimental_evidence Overexpression of a UDP-galactose transporters URGT1 in *Arabidopsis* increased beta-1,4-galactan deposition in leaves 
	- #experimental_evidence Overexpression of UDP-galactose epimerase with galactan synthase in Arabidopsis either with constitutive or secondary cell wall-specific promoters resulted in increased amounts of beta-1,4-galactan in secondary cell wall 

## Mannan
### Challenge for biorefining 
- Mannans are made up of mannose, which are hexose sugars and so are fermented efficiently by yeast. Their proportion could be increased in crops used for biofuel production 

### Modifying mannan content in cell walls
- Overexpression of biosynthetic enzymes
	- #experimental_evidence Overexpression of guar CSLA in soybean embryos increased mannan in soybean seeds by 3% 

## Xylan 
### Challenge for biorefining 
- Xylan acts as a link between cellulose and lignin 
- Structural diversity/complexity (varies depending on plant source), makes it hard to process
- Xylan coating on cellulose protects cellulose from hydrolytic enzymes, thus contributing to recalcitrance
- Sidechains on xylan contribute to recalcitrance, particularly the non-carbohydrate moieties as they block enzymes from accessing the polysaccharides 
	- Some of these groups that are released during enzymatic digestion can inhibit subsequent fermentation, e.g. acetic acid is inhibitory to yeast fermentation 
- Xylan is also made up of a pentose sugar, xylose, which is less efficiently fermented by yeast than hexoses such as glucose 

### Modifying xylan content in cell walls 
- Reducing the amount of xylan in cell walls 
	- Mutants in xylan biosynthesis in Arabidopsis e.g. IRX8 have a dwarf phenotype with collapsed xylem vessels 
	- However, similar silencing of IRX8 in polar reduced xylan and increasing glucose yields without compromising plant growth 
	- Xylan has specialised functions in vessels and in interaction with lignin, so complete substitution probably impossible. Could KO in fiber cells (tissue-specific) instead where xylan is non-essential, so as to not interfere with these functions
- Remove glucuronic acid from xylan 
	- #experimental_evidence Lyczakowski et al (2017) engineered *Arabidopsis* mutants that lack glucuronysl substitutions on xylan by mutating the *gux* gene. This resulted in 30% more glucose and over 700% more xylan to be released during saccharification by an enzymatic cocktail CTec2; the ethanol yields were doubled. 
- Replace acetyl groups with other sidechains 
	- #experimental_evidence Xiong et al (2015) found that when a xylan glucuronosyltransferase was expressed in the Arabidopsis *tbl29* mutant, it rescued the dwarf phenotype while still maintaining a low acetate environment 
		- But glucuronic acid on xylan also contributes to recalcitrance, so while this study illuminates the function of the sidechains on xylan (in that the identity of the sidechian may not be important), it may not be helpful in preventing recalcitrance. 
- Remove ferulate esters on xylan – ferulate esters dimerise, generating crosslinks in xylans that contribute to cell wall recalcitrance 
	- #experimental_evidence Overexpression of rice gene in BAHD family (an acyltransferase), *OsAT10*, increased p-coumaric acid esterification and reduced feruloyl esterification without affecting plant growth significantly. *OsAT10* may act as a p-hdroxycinnamoyltransferase, saturating the xylan with p-coumaric acid esters, thus preventing feruloyl incorporation 
	- #experimental_evidence RNAi against BAHD genes in rice reduced ferulic acid by 20% in cell walls, but it wasn't certain which BAHD genes were downregulated (lol) 

## Modifying cell wall synthesis regulation 
- **Transcription factors**. #experimental_evidence Overexpression of NST1 transcription factor in *Arabidopsis* resulted in higher carbohydrate content in *Arabidopsis* secondary cell walls. NST1 is a TF that controls secondary cell wall biosynthesis in fiber cells in Arabidopsis. The TF was placed under the control of the promoter of the secondary cell wall glycosyltransferase IRX8, which is itself upregulated by NST1. This results in a positive feedback loop and also ensures that NST1 is only expressed in tissues that already have NST1.
- **Cell wall turnover.** Mixed-linkage glucans are degraded in young grass tissues by plant licheninases. #experimental_evidence A maize mutant, candy-leaf1, has a mutation that inactivates a maize licheninase. This doubled the amount of beta-glucan, which increased the hexose content of the cell wall and improved saccharification yield. Plant growth was not affected.

# Glycoside hydrolases 
## Significance for biorefining
- Processing costs for biofuel processing are currently 50% of the product cost 
- Cell walls are complex, need multiple enzymes to fully break it down 
- Enzymatic deconstruction by microorganisms, hydrolytic enzymes can be done under mild conditions with little energy expenditure or chemical waste 
- Engineering GHs for improved use in industrial processes
	- Thermostability – Industrial enzymes have to be stable for weeks or months at room temperature, and digestion at higher temperature allows for faster processing (cheaper)
	- Salt and phenol tolerance – Enzymes must function in semi-solid environments (sludge) of plant biomass which is concentrated in salts, phenolic residues 
	- Efficiency – improve scalability, sugar product yield 
- Creating cheap, stable, thermotolerant and efficient enzyme cocktails to break down plant cell walls can thus reduce the cost of plant biomass refining
	- Reduce pretreatment costs – enzymes cannot digest natural wood on harvesting. If enzymes can work on slightly less pretreated material, more energy + money can be saved on pretreatment costs 

## Structure
### Interaction with polysaccharides 
- Substrate binding cleft can contain residues that allow for interaction with the sugars
	- #structural_evidence Stacking interactions between phenyl rings and sugar rings (Urbanikova et al 2011) 

### Determinants of substrate specificity 
- The substrate binding clefts of GHs contain **subsites** that accommodate the monosaccharide residues within a polysaccharide 
	- Specificity is described with respect to notional subsites towards non-reducing end (-) or reducing end (+)
- **Exo or endo activitiy.** Small loop extensions can create steric constraints around the distal subsite that usually accommodates the non-reducing end of the substrate. This prevents the GH from binding to substrates that extend beyond the subsite. 
	- #structural_evidence E.g. CjMan26A is an endo-mannanase, while CjMan26C is an exo-mannanase. Crystal structures of the two enzymes show that CjMan26C has a small loop extension, consisting of Asp-130 and Leu-129, around the -2 subsite. This sterically blocks extensions of the substrate beyond this subsite. In comparison, the equivalent amino acid to Asp-130 in CjMan26A (Glu-121) does not present such a steric block. 

### Carbohydrate binding modules (CBMs)
- Many microbial plant cell wall hydrolases have a modular structure where the catalytic module is attached to 1 or more CBMs
	- Less prevalent in plant GHs but some modules have been identified in cellulases and xylanases 
- CBMs have been identified that bind to major polysaccharides in the plant cell wall, their sidechains, and the products released following degradation
- **The topology of the binding cleft affects CBM specificity**. CBM binding sites have shapes that mirror the conformations of their substrates in solution state. Even changes can lead to differences in substrate binding specificity. 
	- E.g. CBM6 modules – if the binding site is pocket-like, it recognises the termini of polysaccharide chains, but if it is an open cleft, it can bind to internal regions. 
- **Cellulose CBMs**. Enzymes generally have CBMs that target their cognate substrate, but many enzymes additionally contain a **CBM for crystalline cellulose**. This may allow the enzyme to slide along cellulose to search for the substrate, constraining the search space (to make recognition more efficient?)
	- Cellulose CBMs contain three aromatic amino acids that lie along the same plane, allowing it to make hydrophobic contacts with exposed sugar rings on 110 (hydrophobic?) face of the crystal 
- **Xylan CBMs**. Unlike cellulose CBMs, aromatic residues in xylan-specific CBMs are perpendicular to each other. An Arg residue allows for this perpendicular arrangement, while in cellulose CBMs, there is a Gly, which allows the aromatic residues to lay flat on the surface of the protein. This is to match the shapes of cellulose and xylan. 
	- Some xylan CBMs recognise xylan in other ways, e.g. CBM4 sandwiches a Xyl residue between a pair of planar aromatic residues in a deep ligand binding cleft 
- **Glucomannan CBMs**. Recognition of glucomannan may be more challenging due to heterogeneity in the backbone. CBM29 recognises glucomannan via aromatic residues that make contacts with sugars at n and n+2. This avoids steric clash with the axial O2 in the Man residues. Polar residues also can hydrogen bond with axial or equatorial O2 of Man or Glc respectively. 
- **Xyloglucan CBMs**. CBMs for xyloglucan have been shown to recognise both backbone and sidechains. 
- **CBMs can target enzymes to open structures susceptible to enzyme degradation**. CMB35s in pectin degrading enzymes bind to reaction products generated by pectate lyases (e.g. uronic acid) rather than pectins themselves, recruiting the enzymes to regions in the cell wall where degradation is occurring 
- **Calcium in CBMs can help in ligand recognition**. 
	- In Aga16B-CBM6-2 ,the calcium orientates a Tyr residue to interact with a neoagarose ligand 
	- In CBM36, metal ion coordinates O2 and O3 of Xyl residues in xylan 
- **Avidity effects**. CBMs generally have **low affinities** for their plant ligands, but some enzymes have **multiple copies** of the same CBM, resulting in **avidity** between the modules to increase the affinity for the target 

### Predicting hydrolase activity
- Sequence comparisons cannot always predict activity of a hydrolase
	- Proteins with very different structures can hydrolyse similar polysaccharides
		- #experimental_evidence GH-10 xylanase from *Cellvibrio mixtus* and GH-11 xylanase from *Bacillus subtilis* both hydrolyse xylan 
	- At the same time, proteins with similar structure can bind different glycans, through evolutionary divergence
		- #experimental_evidence GT34 family – diverged into MAGTs and XXTs 
- However, sequence-based classification of modules is possible 

## Activity
### Catalytic mechanism 
- Catalyse cleavage of specific sugar linkages 
- Binds oligosaccharides and distorts it to lower the activation energy for bond cleavage 
- Most glycoside hydrolases cleave glycosidic bonds via a **single or double displacement mechanism**, resulting in inversion or retention of the anomeric configuration, respectively 
- Polysaccharyde lyases cleave scissile bond via **beta-elimination mechanism** 
- Carbohydrate esterases hydrolyse ester linkage via **double displacement mechanism** with Ser or Asp acting as catalytic nucleophile, except in CE4 where catalysis metal-dependent 

### CBMs potentiate catalysis 

## Cellulases 
- Crystalline cellulose is difficult to hydrolyse, but three types of hydrolases act in sequence, exhibiting synergy 
- **Endoglucanases** act on imperfections in crystal 
	- The γ-endoglucanases in *Arabidopsis* are 100-fold less active than homologous microbial enzymes due to the loss of an aromatic residue at the -2 subsite, supporting the idea that such degradative enzymes possess a remodeling role rather than degradative role 
- **Exoglucanases**/**cellobiohydrolases** remove two glucosyl residues (cellobiose) and act from reducing end (CBH1) or non-reducing end (CBH2) 
	- It removes two glucosyl residues as cellulose is made up of repeating units of 2 glucosyl residues that are inverted with respect to each other. Exoglucanase removes cellobiose. 
	- However, they only act on the free ends of chains and on one face only, which limits the amount of cellulose substrate that can be digested 
	- Traffic jams of cellobiohydrolase can inhibit their activity  
		- #experimental_evidence [[IgarashiEtAl_2011]] – AFM of cellobiohydrolase along cellulose microfibrils 
- **Beta-glucosidae** cleaves cellobiose (and other glucose oligosaccharides). 

## Xyloglucan degradation 
- Backbone is hydrolysed by endoglucanases that can tolerate the sidechains on xyloglucan 
	- E.g. GH5 and 74 can tolerate alpha-1,6-Xyl decorations, GH5 can even tolerate the Gal decorations on Xyl residues 

## Mannan degradation 
- Beta-mannanases have an active site with at least 4 subsites 
- "Substrate specificity is not conferred by recognition of Man in its relaxed chair conformation at the -1 subsite, but via B<sub>2,5</sub> topology in the oxocarbonium transition state" (Gilbert 2010)
- Beta-mannanases can hydrolyse both mannan and glucomannan, but there has to be Man in the -1 subsite. Recognition of Man or Glc at other subsites is variable 
	- GH5s accommodate Glc at -2, +1 subsites 
		- Specificity then determined by topographical features of the substrate binding cleft e.g. BaMan5A prefers glucomannan as a substrate 
	- GH26s are specific for Man at both -2 and -1 subsites 
- Endomannanase e.g. CjMan26A – cannot tolerate galactose sidechains, while others e.g. AnGH5 can tolerate galactose sidechains

## Xylan degradation 
- Decorations removed by individual enzymes (e.g. galactosidase, arabinofuranosidase)
	- Arabinofuranosidases in the GH43 family target a range of substrates
- Backbone digested to small oligosaccharides by endoxylanase
	- Endoxylonases often only can act on undecorated backbone 
	- However GH5 xylanase is specific to Xyl with urnonic acid at -2 subsite on xylan; unclear how it recognises this side chain 
- Xylosidase releases monosaccharides from the oligosaccharides (e.g. β-xylosidase)

## Pectin degradation 
- **Catalytic mechanism of pectate lyases of families PL2, PL9, PL10**. Catalytic Arg acts as a base to abstract the C5 proton, resulting in the formation of an enolate-enolate intermediate. The two negatively-charged oxygens are stabilised by calcium and H bonds. Collapse of the intermediate cleaves the scissile bond. 
- **Pectin methyl esterases** remove methyl groups from uronic acid residues in pectin. Enzyme demethylates sugar at +1 subsite. The -1 subsite recognises the negative charge of the carboxylate, while the +3 subsite makes hydrophobic contact with the methyl group of the uronic acid. After removing the methyl group, the uronic acid residue slides along the substrate binding cleft to occupy the -1 subsite, prsenting a new methylated uronic acid at the +1 subsite, allowing for processive methyl group removal. 

# Lytic polysaccharide monooxygenases (LPMOs)
- Found in bacteria, fungi, animals (e.g. *Thermobia domestica*), algae 

## Activity
#### On cellulose 
- LPMOs can create more free ends in crystalline cellulose 
- Rather than hydrolytic cleavage, LPMOs catalyse oxidative cleavage in cellulose 
- LPMOs likely require three substrates: polysaccharide, reductant (most commonly ascorbate), and molecular oxygen (or possibly H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub>)
- LPMO cleavage can yield multiple different products due to action on different oxidation sites e.g. *Ta*AA9A
	- E.g. C1 lytic oxidation of cellobiose produces aldonic acid and aldose
	- E.g. C4 lytic oxidation of cellobiose produces aldose and ketoaldose 
	- As a result, biochemical analysis of LMPO activities is complex than analysis of hydrolase activities
- Other LPMOs only perform a single type of oxidation (e.g. *An*AA13 only oxidises at C1 of starch)

### On hemicellulose
- AA14 family LPMOs degrades xylan 

## Structure
- #structural_evidence Frandsen et al (2016) obtained a crystal structure of LPMO with substrate bound i.e. LsAA9A by binding it to oligosaccharide
	- Other LPMOs challenging to crystallise as they act on polysaccharide 
- All structurally determined LPMOs to date have an IgG-like beta-sandwich fold and histidine-brace motif 
	- Active site contains a copper ion bound by two His residues (histidine brace)
		- N-terminal His methylated in fungi, and this has been suggested to protect the LPMO from autooxidative inactivation 
			- #experimental_evidence Petrovic et al (2018)
		- The methylation may also enhance the electrostatic interaction between the face of the side chain in this His and the ring oxygen of the glucosyl residue in subsite +1 
- #structural_evidence *Td*AA15-A crystal structure showed that it has two almost coplanar Tyr residues on either side of active site 
- There is no clear active site cleft or groove, unlike GHs, indicative of a difference in mechanism 
- 4 loops contribute residues that interact with substrate via hydrogen bonding as well as a highly conserved aromatic residue (Tyr203 in *Ls*AA9A)

## Substrate specificity of LPMOs
- LPMOs can attack beta-1,4-linked polymers of glucose or chitin 
- Hydrolases catalytic activity requires there to be an active site nucleophile on either side of the glycosidic bond, but this is not possible for flat crystalline surfaces
- However, oxidative attack can occur from just one side, so LPMOs can attack polysaccharides in crystalline materials 
	- #experimental_evidence AA10 activity
	- #experimental_evidence Ciano et al (2020) used EPR spectroscopy was used to show that *Ls*AA9A attacks edge of celery cellulose fibres and not the face 
	- #experimental_evidence Eibinger et al (2014) used AFM to show that *Nc*AA9_F localises to crystalline regions of cellulose, allowing hydrolases to digest the substrate 
- Apart from crystalline cellulose, some LPMOs may be able to act on amorphous cellulose as well 
- #experimental_evidence Kracher et al (2018) found that reduction of the copper increases the binding affinity of a *Neurospora crassa* LPMO to a polysaccharide substrate
- AA9 LPMO from the ascomycete *Thielavia terrestris* has an arrangement of aromatic residues that resembles a cellulose CBM – likely referring to coplanar arrangement 

## Catalytic mechanism 
#comment Rework this to be more chemically accurate lol read paper  
- LPMOs primarily oxidise alpha-1,4 or beta-1,4 glucose backbones or chitin 
- The substrates can be oxidised at the C1 or C4 carbons depending on the LPMO 
	- Regiospecificity (i.e. preference for C1 or C4) does not seem to be restricted by family and has been shown to be substrate- or reductant-dependent. Mechanism for regiospecificity is unclear. 
		- #structural_evidence  [[FrandsenEtAl_2016]] determined a crystal structure for *Ls*AA9A. They suggested that for *Ls*AA9A, the preference for oxidising C4 is because the C4-H bond is closer to the copper than the C1-H bond
		- #structural_evidence [[ForsbergEtAl_2014]] determined the structure of two AA10 LPMOs, CelS2 and *Sc*LPMO10B, with different regiospecificities. They proposed that the ability of LPMOs to bind O2 in the axial position determines whether it can oxidise C4. C1/C4-oxidising *Sc*LPMO10b can coordinate a ligand in the axial position of copper, while C1-oxidising CelS2 cannot coordinate ligands in the solvent-facing axial position. This is due to differences in the placement of an active site alanine – in CelS2 the alanine blocks access to the axial position. 
- #structural_evidence In *Ls*AA9A, [[FrandsenEtAl_2016]] also found that cello-oligosaccharide binding results in the C6 CH2OH group in subsite 1 occluding the axial binding site on the copper ion. This results in the copper ion moving towards Tyr164. Occlusion also prevents loss of coordinated superoxide through axial site, which has been observed for *Ta*AA9A

1. 1e- reduction of Cu(II) to Cu(I), e- is relocated to dioxygen upon binding to Cu(I)-LPMO 
2. Oxidation of polysaccharide by hydrogen abstraction from C1 or C4, followed by hydroxylation then elimination to give the final product. H abstraction requires a powerful oxidative species 
	1. In presence of suitable substrate (e.g. cellulose) and oxygen co-substrate -> Monooxygenase reaction, Cu(I) returned to Cu(II) resting state
	2. In presence of H2O2 -> Perooxygenase reaction, Cu(I) remains reduced 
		1. H2O2 can be from an external source or from the futile cycle 
3. If no substrate or H2O2 co-substrate -> futile cycle. Reduced LPMO reacts with O2 to form H2O2. Cu(I) returns to Cu(II) resting state. 

### Monooxygenase reaction 
- Glycosidic bond is held over copper, and electrons move from the electron donor through Tyr to copper reducing Cu (II) to Cu(I). Cu(I) reduced oxygen to form superoxide, which abstracts the H on the C1 or C4

### Peroxygenase reaction 
- LPMO uses electron from an electron donor to reduce Cu (II) to Cu(I). H2O2 used to hydroxylate a carbon (C1 or C4) on the polysaccharide. Hydroxylated product undergoes an elimination reaction, leading to glycosidic bond cleavage. Cu(I) remains reduced. 
- #experimental_evidence [[BissaroEtAl_2020]]

## Discovery of new LPMOs
- Low sequence similarity between LPMOs so difficult to identify, so identified by appended modules instead or from previously described in [[C6 Cell walls, energy, materials#Discovery of novel enzyme activities]] 
- There are a wide variety of LPMOs with different substrates or co-factors, or perhaps attack different faces of hemicellulose-coated cellulose fibrils 

## Biorefining 
- Act synergistically with glycosidic hydrolases in saccharification as it can attack crystalline cellulose, cleaving internal glucosidic bonds not accessible to endo-acting hydrolases. It provides a complementary function 
- H2O2 is produced during pre-treatment of biomass, and this H2O2 could be used as a co-substrate by LPMOs 
	- #experimental_evidence Kont et al (2019) found that the liquid fraction from hydrothermal pre-treatment of wheat straw contains H2O2, which supports LPMO activity on chitin and cellulse 
- On the other hand, the addition of LPMOs to an enzyme cocktail in treatment of wheat straw was found to increase the rate of inactivation of the enzyme mixture, which may be due to the production of H2O2 causing oxidative inactivation. 
	- #experimental_evidence Scott et al (2016) – adding catalase reduces enzyme inactivation 

# Engineering CAZymes
- If enzymes are modular, different enzyme domains can be combined to alter activity 
	- E.g. fusing carbohydrate binding modules (CBMs) can promote enzymatic digestion of intact plant cell walls by targeting it to substrates
		- #experimental_evidence Herve et al (2010) fused arabinofuranosidase to a xylan-binding CBM, which enhanced the removal of side chains on arabinoxylan. Pectate lyase activity was increased by fusing to a cellulose-directed CBM. 
			- The choice of CBM is important – in cellulose poor wheat endosperm cells, a cellulose-CBM may not be helpful 
		- In general, a cellulose-CBM could be useful for many enzymes to keep them in close contact with the cell wall 
	- However, fusing CBM to LPMO found to negatively affect LPMO stability despite increasing activity 
- Directed evolution 
	- #experimental_evidence Palackal et al (2004) – directed evolution of xylanase improves stability. 
- Reconstruction of cellulosomes – cellulosomes are complexes of cellulases found in some anaerobic species. The cellulases have a dockerin domain that interacts with a cohesin module on a scaffoldin protein. This facilitates the synergistic activity between different cellulases 
	- #experimental_evidence Mori et al (2013) reconstructed an artificial cellulosome by conjugating the endoglucanase Cel5A from *Thermobifida fusca* onto a DNA scaffold. This construct was able to hydrolyse crystalline cellulose (Avicel). 
 
## Discovery of novel enzyme activities
- Purification from cultures based on enzymatic assay that identifies glycoside hydrolase activity 
- Screening randomly expressed cDNAs from fungi, bacteria for glycoside hydrolase activity e.g. release of chromogenic dye from substrate using droplet microfluidics, this can be done in a highthroughput way
	- See [[A9 Directed Evolution (OLD)]]
- Proteomic detection of secreted enzymes from fungi that are grown on wood/straw – fungi grown on such substrates are likely to synthesise enzymes that can break it down for absorption 
	- E.g. cellulases, CH61/AA9 and other enzymes were induced by growth on cellulose, wood. Xylanases and other enzymes induced by xylan 
	- Subsequently, RNA sequencing of fungi grown on different substrates can be provide new targets 
	- E.g. "GH61" – LPMO (see [[C6 Cell walls, energy, materials#Lytic polysaccharide monooxygenases (LPMOs)]])
- Prospecting from the environment 
	- Metaproteomics
	- Metagenomics
		- Sequencing genes from complex consortia of fungi, bacteria from various environments, e.g. compost heaps, soil, cow rumen, termite gut, etc. 
		- Hydrolase candidates can then be identified by comparing the encoded protein sequences to CAZy sequences 
			- May limit search if only use CAZy database, search might be expanded by using BLAST and a more general gene database 
		- #experimental_evidence Hess et al (2011)
	- Suitable environment has to be chosen. 
		- #experimental_evidence Cellulosomes in *Clostridial* bacteria concentrate hydrolase activities at the surface, rather than being secreted. Hydrolases consist of CBM and catalytic domain, but also a *dockerin* domain that allows them to assemble on a scaffold protein by interacting with cohesion on the scaffold. This assembly forms the cellulosome (Fontes & Gilbert 2010). New GHs can thus be identified from *Clostridial* bacteria by finding ones genetically fused to dockerin
		- #experimental_evidence Gut microbes are able to break down complex carbohydrates in dietary fibre. Bacteroidetes, a bacteria phylum in the human gut microbiome, has many homologous breakdown systems for different polysaccharides (Terrapon & Henrissat 2014). Enzymes/proteins involved in these systems are encoded by polysaccharide utilisation loci (PULs) on the bacterial genome, and each PUL is expressed in response to different polysaccharides. 
			- #experimental_evidence  Xylan PUL in *B. ovatus* – encodes an extracellular GH30 glucuronoxylanase makes large oligosaccharides, SuC/D-like proteins for oligosaccharide uptake, GH10 xylanases, GH115 glucuronidase, GH3 xylosidase, etc. Many novel enzyme activities can be found in different PULs that re likely involved in polysaccharide degradation (Rogowski et al 2015)
			- Different bacterial species make use of different sets of polysaccharides; as such, dietary availability of polysaccharides can lead to growth of specific species but not others, altering the composition of our gut microbiome 
			- Exchange of genes between bacteria means extensive evolution of gene clusters
