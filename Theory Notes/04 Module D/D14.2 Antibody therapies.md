# Antibody structure 
![[Pasted image 20230411212252.png|325]]
# Advantages / Disadvantages
## Advantages 
- Flexible modulation of target 
- Recruitment of immune effectors 
- Selective for target 
- Predictable pharmacokinetics 
- May be less susceptible to resistance 

## Disadvantages
 - Poor pharmacological modulation
 - Cannot cross blood brain barrier, so CNS delivery is challenging 
 - Can only attack targets on membrane surfaces (receptors) or transient extracellular targets (growth factors, hormones), so a clear biomarker is needed.
	 - However tumours are heterogenous, so what is expressed on one tumour may not be useful for another 
 - Cannot vary pharmacokinetics, so not as able to provide short acute responses 
 - More expensive to produce 
 - Tumours can also possess or later on acquire resistance against antibody therapy 

### Mechanisms of resistance 
- Mutations of antibody target
	- Could be overcome by using antibodies against different epitopes
		- E.g. S492R in EGFR results in resistance to cetuximab but not panitumumab as they recognise different epitopes 
- Downregulation of antibody target 
	- Cell lines chronically exposed to rituximab acquire resistance by downregulating CD20 at transcriptional, translational level 
	- Multiple myeloma patients treated with anti-CD38 daratumumab lost CD38 expression in tumours 
	- Trastuzumab-mediated ADCC induces IFNγ release from NK cells, resulting in activation of JAK-STAT pathway which downregulates HER2 in tumour cells 
- Alterations in pathway downstream of antibody target
	- E.g. Cetuximab resistance in colorectal cancer due to mutations in effectors of EGFR e.g. KRAS, BRAF, which compensate for reduced activation by EGFR 
	- Ras activation leads to upregulation of anti-apoptotic Bcl-2, conferring resistance to mAb induced apoptosis 
	- Mutant HER2 leads to dysregulation of PI3K-AKT pathway, upregulating anti-apoptotic pathway to enable resistance to trastuzumab 
- Use alternative growth signalling pathways 
	- Overexpression of EGFR, insulin-like growth factor-1 receptor can confer resistance to trastuzumab, which targets HER2 
- EMT 
	- Found to mediate resistance to cetuximab in head-and-neck cancer via a number of mechanisms, including loss of EGFR expression 
- Impair effector cell response 
	- Cell lines with mutant KRAS had impaired Fas-FasL interaction to trigger apoptosis by NK cells 
	- PD-L1 upregulation in tumour cells confers resistance to NK ADCC by binding PD-1

# Target selection criteria for mAbs 
This is similar to other therapeutics: 
- Relevant to tumorigenesis 
- Differential expression vs normal cells (selectivity)
- Distribution homogeneity
- Retained expression 
- Capacity for patient stratification 
- For mAbs conjugated to a payload, the target must be capable of internalisation upon antibody binding so that the drug can be released 

e.g. CD20 – specific to mature B cells, abundnantly expressed on malignant B cells in Hodgkin's lymphoma, but not found on healthy immature B cells 

# Mechanism 
mAbs are targeted to antigens that are specific to tumour cells. This can cause cell death via various mechanisms: 
- Antibody-dependent cell cytotoxicity (ADCC)
- Apoptosis induction 
- Ligand neutralisation 
- Receptor neutralisation 
- Antibody-drug conjugate
- Antibody-isotope conjugate 
- Immune checkpoint modulation  
- Complement directed cytotoxicity

## Block growth factor receptor signalling 
- Cetuximab is an anti-EGFR, preventing ligand binding and receptor dimerisation 
- Trastuzumab (Herceptin) is an anti-Her2 Ab
	- Her2 is an RTK, mostly overexpressed in ovarian and breast cancers, that dimerises with other growth factor receptors to enhance their activation 

## Complement directed cytotoxicity 
- E.g. rituximab depends partly on CDC 
	- #experimental_evidence Rituximab not effective against tumours when complement cascade component C1q is knocked out 
	- Genetic polymorphisms in C1qA correlate with how well follicular lymphoma patients respond to rituximab 

## Antibody-dependent cellular phagocytosis (ADCP)
- Occurs when FcγRI expressed on phagocytic cells (e.g. macrophages) bind IgG1 or IgG3 mAbs that have opsonised a tumour cell 

## Antibody-directed cell cytotoxicity (ADCC)
1. Fab region of mAb engages target antigen expressed on target cell surface
2. Fc region of mAb engages Fcγ receptors expressed on effector cell surface
	1. Effector is usually NK cell but can also be macrophage, monocytes, neutrophils, eosinophils, dendritic cells 
3. Effector cell releases granzymes and perforins to effect ADCC, resulting in target cell death. Also FAS signalling, initiation of ROS 

IgA, IgG, and IgE can all mediate ADCC but IgG1 is usually used for caner therapy 

### Tuning efficacy of ADCC by adjusting binding between Fc and Fcγ
- **Modification of attached carbohydrates.** Fucose residues on antibody are central to formation of interface with Fcγ receptor. Removing fucose can thus increase binding to Fcγ
- **Mutate FcgRIII**. FcgRIII polymorphisms impact ADCC competence
	- Certain genotypes code for FcγRs with higher affinity for IgG1, leading to stronger ADCC activity 
		- #experimental_evidence Lymphoma patients with polymorphism for stronger ADCC were shown to have better clinical response to rituximab 
		- #experimental_evidence Genotypes of FcγRIIA and FcγRIIIA with higher affinity for Fc were correlated with better survival in colorectal cancer patients given cetuximab and metastatic breast cancer patients given trastuzumab, respectively 
![[Pasted image 20230411213206.png|275]]

- #experimental_evidence Trastuzumab (herceptin) is an antibody that elicits ADCC against Her2-positive cancer cells. It also inhibits ligand-independent Her2 dimerisation, inhibits PI3K-AKT signalling, and causes Her2 receptor internalisation. 
	- #experimental_evidence Clynes et al (2000) – Fcγ receptor KO removes tumour suppressive effect of trastuzumab, so ADCC is key. 
	- #experimental_evidence in mouse models with mutant FcγR incapable ADCC, mAb therapy could not clear the tumours 
	- Extended overall survival of patients with metastatic breast cancer 
	- When used in combination with pertazumab, another antibody, it is more effective as pertazumab inhibits ligand-dependent Her2 heterodimerisation 
	- ADCC can be enhanced with other antibodies, e.g. margetuximab 

## Antibody:drug conjugates 
### Mechanism 
- Tether antibody to a cytotoxic payload, which is taken into cell via receptor-mediated endocytosis 
- Cytotoxicity of payload and amount of payload per Ab can be tuned
- Target specificity and pharmacokinetics of payload depends on Ab 
- But susceptible to development of drug resistance 
![[Pasted image 20230411213400.png|325]]
- #experimental_evidence Antibody-drug conjugates used to deliver a cytotoxic payload to herceptin-resistant Her2+ve breast cancer 
	- Advantage is that downstream pathways of Her2 receptor are irrelevant to the efficacy of the therapeutic, since it has a different mechanism of action to ADCC
	- Trastuzumab emtansine – consists of the trastuzumab antibody linked to the cytotoxic agent DM1. DM1 binds to tubulin to cause mitotic arrest and cell death. 
	- Trastuzumab deruxtecan – consists of trastuzumab linked to a topoisomerase inhibitor
		- As payload is more potent, less HER2 expression is required 
	- However, it has some efficacy against cells with baseline HER2 expression as well, risking side effects similar to in regular chemotherapy 
- E.g. brentuximab vedotin – mAb targeting lymphoma CD30, linked to a microtubule destabilising agent 
- Apart from conjugating to drugs, antibodies could be conjugated to biologic toxins
	- Most are too toxic for safe use in patients
	- However the *Pseudomonas* exotoxin A (PE) toxin has been conjugated to an anti-CD22 for hair-cell leukemia 

### Considerations 
- Systemic v local exposure of cytotoxic payload 
- Stability of conjugate 
- Expression of target in normal tissue 
- Susceptibility of tumour cell to cytotoxic payload 

## Target protumourigenic TME factors  
- E.g. bevacizumab targets **VEGF** to prevent it from binding to VEGFR, thus preventing tumours from stimulating angiogenesis in adjacent endothelial cells 
	- Alternatively, target VEGFR (e.g. ramucirumab, icrucumab)
- E.g. Fresolimumab targets TGF-β

## Immune checkpoint modulation 
[[D14.3 Immune therapies#Checkpoint inhibitors|Checkpoint inhibitors]]
- MHC presentation on tumour cells and APC of tumour specific antigens can be targets for immune attack 
- Activated T cells have high cytotoxic potential, but their effects are attenuated by immune checkpoint pathways ![[Pasted image 20230411214737.png|375]]
- Targeting immune checkpoints by using an antibody that engages the CTLA-4 can remove this attenuation ![[Pasted image 20230411214822.png|200]]
- Blocking CTLA-4 with antibodies with Fc domains to deplete Tregs can regress tumours 
- E.g. Ipilimumab is anti-CTLA-4 mAb, had promising results in trials with melanoma patients 
- E.g. anti-PD-1 mAb nivolumab shown effectiveness in melanoma patients 

## Deplete immunosuppressive cells 
- Antibody-mediated depletion of Tregs 
	- E.g. daclizumab blocks CD25 on Tregs 

## Co-stimulatory agonist 
- E.g. CD40 agonist antibody stimulate antigen presentation by dendritic cells
- E.g. mAbs to OX40, 4-1BB activate T cells while dampening activity of Tregs 

## Immune cell engagers
![[D14.3 Immune therapies#Immune cell engagers (ICEs)]]

# Patient stratification 
- If we know the mechanism of action of the antibodies, we can identify patients whose tumour or TMEs are amenable to the particular antibody therapy 
- How to stratify patient? Biopsy -> sequencing, immunohistochemistry 
- Important considerations for the effectiveness of treatment would be 
	- Where is the tumour - CNS delivery is challenging 
	- Expression of suitable antigens on tumour surface -> mAbs for antigens 
	- Is TME immunosuppressive? -> co-stimulators, checkpoint blockades, depletion of immunosuppressive cells
	- Challenging delivery due to ECM -> ECM breakdown e.g. with MMPs 
	- Presence of protumourigenic TME factors in TME or presence of protumourigenic TME processes e.g. angiogenesis -> mAbs against these factors 
	- Primary or acquired resistances 
		- Mutations in antigen expression -> change mAb used to target different epitope or antigen 
		- Downregulation of antibody target -> change mAb used to target different antigen 
		- Alterations in pathway downstream of antibody target -> different antigen, combination therapy? 
		- Use of alternative growth signalling pathways 
		- EMT 
		- Impaired cell effector response -> co-stimulators, checkpoint blockades 
	- Adjust mAb used based on genetic background of patient 
		- C1q polymorphisms -> CDC mechanism 
		- FcgRIII polymorphisms -> ADCC mechanism 
- Combination therapies could be prescribed to overcome some of the challenges in antibody therapy 

# Benefits of using multiple mechanisms 
- **Overcoming Resistance**: Cancers can evolve or acquire resistance to a particular mAb, in which case a mAb targeting a different epitope or antigen can be effective 
	- E.g. HER2 can be targeted by different mAbs, trastuzumab and pertuzumab. While trastuzumab targets the site where HER2 binds to another HER2, pertuzumab targets binding site for HER3 
- **Combination Therapy** 
	- E.g. combining trastuzumab and pertuzumab can have a synergistic effect 
- **Personalised medicine**: Can choose the best option for the patient in terms of clinical response and minimal side effects
	- If TME immunosuppressive, can combine HER2 mAb with e.g. checkpoints blockade, agonist antibodies, or use an antibody-drug conjugate to kill tumour cell without relying on immune cells 
	- Customise antibody for the patient's genotype -> ADCC
	- Or switch between trastuzumab and pertuzumab if patient has allergic reaction to one 
	- Level of HER2 expression – trastuzumab deruxtecan has a more potent payload than trastuzumab emtansine, so less HER2 expression required for same efficacy
