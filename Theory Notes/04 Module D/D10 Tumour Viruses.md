# How viruses cause cancer
## Direct vs indirect  carcinogens
Viruses can be 
- Direct carcinogens: Express viral oncogenes that directly contribute to cancer cell transformation, e.g. MCV, EBV, KSHV
- Indirect carcinogens: Cause cancer through chronic infection and inflammation, leading to carcinogenic mutations in host cells (e.g. HCV, HBV, HTLV), or by causing deregulated expression of genes encoded by other viruses (e.g. HIV), or via hit-and-run mechanisms (no clear examples, but maybe HPV types from beta genus)

## General mechanisms 
- **Immunosuppression**: Viruses that cause immunosuppression (e.g. HIV) can facilitate the expression of viral oncogenes as it allows for the expression of foreign proteins that would otherwise be targeted by the immune system. 
- **Chronic inflammation**: Chronic tissue damage and repair can lead to neoplasia and cancer by increasing the number of DNA replication events (to regenerate the tissue), thus increasing the chance of mistakes during DNA replication and cell division, e.g. Hepatitis B and C -> liver cirrhosis -> liver cancer 
- **Virus induced transformation**: Many viruses encode genes involved in cell cycle progression required for viral life cycle, but can predispose to cancer (e.g. small tumour viruses HPV, HPyV, adenoviruses)

## Viral life cycle in virus-induced transformation 
- There is an inverse relationship between virus replication (i.e. permissiveness) and cell transformation, such that **abortive infections are tumourigenic**. Deregulation of viral genes involved in cell cycle progression underlies tumourigenesis. 
	- #experimental_evidence SV40, a simian polyomavirus, transformed cultured human cells efficiently only when mutations are introduced into its replication origin to prevent viral replication 
	- #experimental_evidence Some human adenoviruses can cause tumours in experimental animals (e.g. rats) in cells that support expression of viral early genes, but not the complete productive cycle
	- #experimental_evidence High-risk HPVs cause abortive infections in humans 
- Other viruses may exist in a **pseudo-latent state** to progress the cancer, e.g. KSHV and EBV. It is called pseudo-latent as the pattern of viral gene expression resembles those seen during latency (i.e. when virus is integrated into host cell genome and is not expressing its full complement of genes)
	- Viral protein expression are limited to a few crucial, non-structural viral products that include oncogenic proteins and miRNAs
	- Viral genome is not packaged into virions but is replicated along with host cell genome using replication machinery of cell, tethered to chromosomes as a naked circular genome 
	- As infected cells can detect latent virus infection, viruses in the latent state must express proteins that deactivate cell cycle arrest and pro-apoptotic pathways that are normally triggered to counter viral infection. However, these processes also facilitate cancer development 
- HTLV-1 is in an **abortive infection** stage during precancerous stages, and **pseudo-latent infection** during the cancer. 
	- Viral genome is maintained as integrated DNA provirus that is largely transcriptionally silent in ATLL cancer cells. 
	- **Abortive**:  Viral oncoprotein TAX is expressed to promote early precancerous cell expansion and survival
	- **Pseudo-latent**: Viral oncoprotein HBZ continues to be expressed in mature ATLL cells, and may maintain cell transformation 

## Retroviruses
### Acutely-transforming retroviruses (oncogene-transducing)
E.g. Rous Sarcoma virus (RSV), derivatives of murine leukaemia virus
- These viruses have accidentally acquired (transduced) cellular genes (a proto-oncogene) as part of their replication cycle
	- E.g. in RSV, the Src lacks part of the gene that encodes the regulatory C-terminal portion of the protein, including the inhibitory Y527 phosphorylation site, such that the Src becomes constitutively active 
- The viruses do not gain any benefit from the cellular gene they acquire, and in most cases the acquisition of the cellular protooncogene results in a loss of viral sequences, such that the virus becomes replication incompetent 
	- RSV is unusual in that it retains replication competence despite transduction of Src 

### Retrovirus where oncogene is structural protein
e.g. Jaagsiekte Sheep Retrovirus 
- JSRV causes ovine pulmonary adenocarcinoma
- Expression of JSRV envelope protein activates signal transduction pathways that result in cell proliferation, and infected cells proliferate along the walls of the alveoli 
	- JSRV may interact with cellular receptor, hyaluronidase 2, which is a GPI-anchored protein, to activate the signalling pathways
	- There may also be direct interaction between the C-terminus f the viral TM envelope protein and cellular signal transduction machinery 
- Unusually, tumourigenesis does confer a fitness advantage, as the resultant increased fluid production in the lung facilitates virus transmission 

### Slow transforming retroviruses 
- The virus is oncogene-deficient, but promote tumourigenesis by integrating in the genome within the vicinity of a cellular protooncogene. 
- As the promoter and enhancer-containing LTR has been intergrated, retroviral insertion can upregulate cellular genes over long distances (**insertional activation**)

#### HTLV-1
- HTLV-1 may be particularly effective as a tumour virus because HTLV-1 particles are inefficient at infecting cells, such that HTLV-1 infection is mainly mediated by the transfer of infected cells rather than free virus particles. Thus, to expand and persist, HTLV-1 drives clonal expansion of infected cells to spread within the host. This means there is a fitness advantage if a HTLV-1 strain can drive clonal expansion. 
- Initially, **Tax** is expressed to initiate cellular transformation
	- It acts as a transactivator, binding to the cellular transcription factor CREB, allowing it to activate cellular genes that contain CRE regulatory sequences in their promoters. CREB pathway is involved in cell growth, survival, and apoptosis 
	- Tax activates NF-κβ pathways by associating with IKKγ, allowing for the nuclear import of RELA-p50 and RELB-p52 transcription factors
	- Tax also promotes phosphorylation of Akt by binding to PI3K, promoting cell survival and proliferation 
- After initial transformation, **HBZ** maintains ATLL proliferation 
	- HBZ binds CREB to reduce its association with Tax, reducing transcription of the Tax gene. This allows the tumour cells to avoid immune detection as Tax is highly immunogenic 
	- HBZ has a basic leucine zipper motif, and binds to DNA through heterodimerisation with other bZIP proteins (e.g. cJun, JUNB, JUND), which are components of the AP1 transcription factor. HBZ thus activates AP1-mediated transcription of cellular genes 
	- HBZ mRNA can also associate with E2F proteins to promote proliferation 

## Small DNA tumour viruses
As exemplified by HPV, but also contains MCV, adenoviruses 

### HPV
#### HPV diversity 
- High-risk HPVs that cause cancer are in the Alpha genus 
	- High-risk HPV is widespread throughout the population but is often cleared by the host immune system after persisting for few months-few years. However, individuals who cannot clear the virus and thus maintain deregulated expression of viral genes over a long period of time (years-decades) can get cancer. 
- Low-risk HPVs do not typically cause cancer, but is possible during persistent HPV11 infection (e.g. recurrent respiratory papillomatosis), or in Beta HPV infections in immunosuppressed patients, or in individuals with epidermodysplasia verruciformis. 

#### HPV Alpha mechanism of action 
- The steps that occur for HPV to cause cancer are generally not a normal part of its life cycle, so the ability of HPV (and other DNA tumour viruses) to cause cancer should be seen as a deregulation of its life cycle 
- HPV causes cancer by integration of the genome into the host cell genome
	- Genome integration is not a normal part of the life cycle of the small DNA tumour viruses 
- **E6 and E7 genes are required for cell proliferation** 
	- Viral oncogenes usually serve an important role in the life cycle of each virus, but behave as oncogenes when mutated or when their expression is deregulated 
	- **In the normal viral life cycle, E6 and E7 are required for viral genome amplification**. After infecting epithelial cells, viral episomes are maintained in the epithelial basal layer, requiring the viral E1 and E2 replication proteins. Among the low-risk HPV types, E6 and E7 are only activated in the upper epithelial layers to allow viral genome amplification in preparation for virus packaging. 
	- In low-risk HPV types, E7 targets p130 Rb, while **high risk E7 proteins can target all members of Rb family** including p105 and 107 to facilitate proliferation of infected basal cells 
	- **E6 binds to and degrades cellular p53 protein**; however high-risk E6 does this better than low-risk 
		- High-risk E6 efficiently recruits cellular ubiquitin ligase (E6AP) to cellular p53, resulting in its degradation 
		- This prevents E7 activation of Rb from being countered by activation of p16 and p14, which activate Arf-mdm2-p53 intrinsic tumour suppression pathway (see [[D3 Oncogenes and Tumour Suppressors#Intrinsic tumour suppression|intrinsic tumour suppression]])
	- High-risk E6 have PDZ motif in C-terminus, allowing them to **modify functions of cellular PDZ domain proteins**, e.g. dIg, MAGI, scribble, which **regulate epithelial polarity**. #question how is this important for tumourigenesis? 
	- **High-risk E6 and E7 suppress cellular proteins involved in immune regulation**, e.g. IRF3 (interferon response factor 3, Tyk2 (involved in cytokine signalling), TAP1 (involved in peptide presentation on MHC), and components of cGAS/STING innate immunity sensor 
- **High-risk HPV mainly causes cancer at a restricted group of epithelial sites** that support deregulated viral gene expression
	- Cervical cancers usually arise at a cervical region known as the cervical transformation zone, a site that undergoes metaplasia at puberty, where the single layer of columnar cells that line the endocervix forms a protective multi-layered squamous epithelium 
	- High-risk HPV infection at this site can cause cervical neoplasia, in the viruses undergo abortive infection 

#### Hit and run mechanism for beta HPV types? 
- Beta HPV members can cause non-melanoma skin cancers in immunosuppressed individuals due to deregulation of viral gene expression 
	- Beta HPV is variably present in the cancers they cause, suggesting that these viruses may sometimes contribute to skin cancer development via a hit and run mechanism. This means that they cause the initial transformation of the cells, and transformation is maintained even with the loss of viral molecules, and so are not detected in the cancer. 
- Beta HPV members encode proteins that can interfere with DNA repair and UV-induced apoptosis. These proteins normally contribute to long-term survival of infected cell in epithelial basal layer
	- Unlike with the alpha proteins, these proteins target the proapoptotic protein BAK for degradation ([[D4 Apoptosis#Bax and Bak|Bax and Bak]])
- Beta HPV types also inhibit NOTCH pathway that controls ability of infected cells to differentiate 

#### Management of cervical cancer 
- **Cervical screening**: To detect abnormalities in cells from surface of cervix. HPV-associated cancers develop over decades, so regular testing allows for precancerous lesions to be detected early before they become life-threatening 
	- Cytological screening
	- DNA testing 
	- Biomarker tests e.g. P16 is abundantly expressed in precancerous cervical neoplasia and cancer 
- **Vaccination**. Prophylatic vaccines (e.g. Gardasil) can protect against high-risk HPV16 and 18, as well as low-risk HPV types HPV11 and 6.
	- Most recent vaccine is made up of virus-like particles from 9 HPV types (6, 11, 16, 18, 31, 33, 45, 52, 58) to provide better protection coverage against HPVs
- No antivirals exist to treat HPV. 

### Polyomavirus 
- e.g. Merkel cell polyomavirus (MCPyV) causes merkel cell carcinoma (MCC)
- MCPyV genome is integrated into host cell chromosome 
- MCPyV large T (LT) proteins can bind and inactivate pRb family members, required for sustained growth of MCC tumour cells
- Small T (sT) protein modifies eukaryotic initiation factor function and inhibits proteasomal degradation of LT, as well as other cell cycle activator (e.g. cMyc, cyclinE)
- MCPyV infection downregulates expression of MHC-1, Toll-like receptor 9 and components of NF-κβ pathway 
- In normal life cycle, MCPyV completes productive life cycle in dermal fibroblasts, but may infect bystander Merkel cells, which they abortively infect as these cells do not support productive infection. 

# Evidence that viral infection causes cancer 
- Only 7 viruses have been causally implicated in the development of human cancers, and each have close relatives that do not cause human cancer; as such, only a small number of viruses cause cancer. 
- This is because virus-associated cancers are **dead-ends**, and thus offer the virus **no evolutionary benefit**. Evolutionary selection pressure usually acts to optimise virus survival rather than the development of cancer, as uncontrolled cell proliferation can lead to the death of the host. 

## Koch's Postulates 
Koch's postulates are 4 criteria proposed by Robert Koch to show that a microorganism causes a disease. 

> 1.  The microorganism must be found in abundance in all organisms suffering from the disease but should not be found in healthy organisms.
> 2. The microorganism must be isolated from a diseased organism and grown in pure culture. 
> 3. The cultured microorganism should cause disease when introduced into a healthy organism.
> 4. The microorganism must be re-isolated from the inoculated, diseased experimental host and identified as being identical to the original specific causative agent.

As tumour viruses do not necessarily fulfil all 4 postulates, demonstrating a causal link can be challenging. The main problem is that the ability to cause cancer is not part of most tumour virus' normal life cycle, and viruses can often exist in latency, such that they only cause cancer *sometimes*. Viral molecules may also be lost following the initial transformation ("hit and run"), such that the virus cannot be isolated or re-isolated. 

## Cell-free transmission 
- #experimental_evidence Cell-free transmission of myxomatosis in rabits
- #experimental_evidence Cell-free transmission of papillomavirus in humans causes warts (benign epithelial tumour)
- #experimental_evidence Cell-free transmission of cancer using a cell-free filtrate from a sarcomatous chest tumour from a Plymouth Rock hen (Rous sarcoma viruss), and similar transmission of avian erythroblastosis. Both caused by derivatives of avian leukosis virus (ALV)
- #experimental_evidence Co-carcinogen stimulated benign epithelial tumour caused by a papillomavirus in rabbits 

## Virology approaches 
- #experimental_evidence EM used to identify Epstein Barr virus in cell lines derived from Burkitt's Lymphoma patients 
- #experimental_evidence Decade-long longitudinal epidemiological studies of Taiwanese insurance company cohorts showed that HBV was associated with hepatocellular carcinoma 
- #experimental_evidence HTLV-1 identified from cell lines derived from a case of adult T cell leukaemia. Researchers searched for reverse transcriptase activity in a panel of T cell lines, due to an earlier discovery that a gibbon retrovirus causes T cell leukaemia 

## Molecular biology approaches 
- #experimental_evidence High risk HPV DNA found by low stringency cross hybridisation in cancers and in cell lines derived from cervical cancers 
- #experimental_evidence Hepatitis C virus was identified by antibody panning of a randomly primed cDNA library made from sera of experimentally infected chimpanzees. 
- #experimental_evidence Human herpes virus found by physical nucleic acid subtraction approach. Basically, a normal tissue and a cancer tissue was sequenced, then differences in the DNA content of the healthy and cancer tissue were examined. 
- #experimental_evidence MCV identifed using computational subtraction method comparing cDNA sequences from Merkel Cell Carcinoma (MCC) tissue and adjacent normal tissue 

## Future discovery of tumour viruses 
- Immunosuppression-related tumours (e.g. Non-melanotic skin tumours, non-Hodgkin's lymphomas) are good candidates for future cancer virus discovery
