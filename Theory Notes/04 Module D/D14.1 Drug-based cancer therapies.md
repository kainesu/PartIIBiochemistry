- Therapeutic window = concentration range of therapeutic agent between basement of efficacy and ceiling of toxicity 
- Targeted cancer therapies are drugs or other substances that block growth and spread of cancer by interfering with specific molecules essential for tumour growth and progression. Targeted cancer therapies are selective against cancer cells, are less harmful to normal cells, and more effective than other types of non-targeted treatment e.g. chemotherapy, radiotherapy 

# Cytotoxic chemotherapies 
Damage DNA or interfere with DNA synthesis and/or its repair 

## Examples and their mechanisms of action 

| Drug                     | Effect                                                    |
| ------------------------ | --------------------------------------------------------- |
| Alkylating agents        | Damage DNA to interfere with replication, transcription   |
| Antimetabolites          | Introduce obstructive chemical aberrations into DNA       |
| Microtubule inhibitors   | Block microtubule polymerisation or depolymerisation      |
| Topoisomerase inhibitors | Tangle replicating DNA strands                            |
| Antibiotics              | Inhibit transcription, translation                        |
| Hydroxyurea              | Blocks ribonucleoside diphosphate reductase               |
| Arsenic                  | Induces differentiation in acute promyelocytic leukaemias |
| Proteasome inhibitors    | Blocks intracellular degradation machineries              |

## Limitations 
- Limited efficacy as tumour cells may be innately resistant or acquire resistance after use
- Highly toxic to normal tissues as well, particularly to fast-growing cells in proliferative tissues (e.g. gut lining, hair follicles, bone marrow, oral mucosa) so there is a narrow therapeutic window and lots of side effects
- Great heterogeneity in responses across patients and cancer types
	- It's often not possible to predict which patients will respond to chemotherapy and which won't, and so many patients are over-treated 

# Rational cancer drug development
- Use genomics to identify cancer specific genes and develop drugs that target them 
- Personalised cancer therapy – develop a molecular profile of a particular patient, identify markers predictive of drug sensitivity/resistance and of adverse events, and provide effective drugs. 

# Small molecule inhibitors 
## Properties
- Able to penetrate cell membrane
- Interfere with function of target protein
- Optimised for good pharmacokinetics (i.e. how body processes drug) and pharmacodynamics (i.e. how drug affects the body)
	- Pharmacokinetics – Liberation of drug from formulation, Absorption of drug into circulation/target, Distribution of drug around body, Metabolism of drug, Excretion of drug, etc. 
	- Pharmacodynamics – inhibitory effect on target and toxicity (on-target/off-target)

## Targets
- Targeting proteins directly
	- Some proteins can be difficult to target directly, e.g. Ras GTPase domain has small surface area, not really electrostatic (See [[A7 G proteins#Direct targeting of Ras|Direct targeting of Ras]])
		- Some progress has been made using structure-based drug design, e.g. #experimental_evidence Kessler et al (2019) discovered a new nanomolar inhibitor of the switch I/II pocket on KRAS using structure-based drug design 
	- E.g. Targeting Bcr-Abl with Imatinib 
		- Development of drug resistance led to development of 2nd and 3rd generation drugs that can target resistant mutants as well, e.g. Dasatinib, Nilotinib 
		- Mutations in gatekeeper residues in ATP binding pocket determine sensitivity to small molecule inhibitors 
- Targeting localisation 
	- E.g. Farnesyl transferase inhibitors (FTIs) to prevent localisation of Ras to the membrane (see [[A7 G proteins#Targeting membrane interaction of Ras|Targeting membrane interactions of Ras]])
		- However, FTIs failed! There is a compensatory mechanism in the form of geranyl transferases that add a geranyl geranyl group that still allows for Ras localisation 
		- GTI developed, but using both FTIs and GTIs is really toxic – cannot be used as no therapeutic window. 
- Target downstream effectors
	- E.g. Vemurafenib is a highly selective inhibitor for oncogenic BRAF (See [[D3 Oncogenes and Tumour Suppressors#MAPK pathway|MAPK pathway]])
		- But the inhibitor promotes dimerisation with and hyperactivation of cRaf to alleviate the negative feedback, resulting in paradoxical RAF activation 
			- Signalling pathways are not linear – negative feedback, signalling thresholds
	- Adaptive rewiring is a problem 
		- Drugs have been developed to bypass resistance 
- Combination therapies 
	- E.g. use BRAF inhibitors with MEK, ERK, mTor, PI3K inhibitors
	- E.g. use BRAF inhibitors with immune checkpoint inhibitors (vemurafenib + ipilimumab)
- Synthetic lethality – cell toxicity induced by combining two modalities that is neither in itself sufficient to affect viability (see [[D2 DNA damage repair#Synthetic lethality|Synthetic lethality]])
	- Identify characteristics of cancers that are under strong positive selection but bring with them new vulnerabilities 
	- E.g. PARP inhibitors in BRCA1/BRCA2-deficient cancers. These are deficient in ds break repair, making them more reliant on ss repair. 

But if cancers heterogenous -> not all cells in the tissue are responsive? 

## Future improvements
- Stratifying patient populations 
	- Personalised genomics
- Combination therapies 
- Better understanding of signalling pathways
