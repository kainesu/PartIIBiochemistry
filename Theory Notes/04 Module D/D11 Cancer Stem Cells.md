# Questions 
- What properties do stem cells and cancer-propagating cells have in common and how are they different?
- Cancer is caused by stem cells. Discuss.
- Does self-renewal occur in cancer? Discuss the evidence and consider the implications for potential therapeutic approaches.

# Cancer stem cells vs stem cells
## Properties of cancer stem cells
- Non-physiological proliferation i.e. corrupted cell cycle control 
- Distinct from other cancer cells 
- Able to kill organism 
- Treatment resistance 
	- Patient may enter remission because most cancer cells are killed. But if some cancer stem cells survive, they can eventually start proliferating again and cause relapse 
- Affected by the tumour microenvironment 

## CSC markers 
Include many CDs, ABCB5

## Properties of stem cells 
### Self-proliferation 
Stem cells can undergo symmetric division to form two stem cells 

### Differentiation 
Stem cells can undergo asymmetric division to form another stem cell (to renew stem cell pool) and a differentiated cell  
![[Pasted image 20230405172736.png|150]]
### Durability 
Stem cells are durable, able to survive many injuries throughout the lifecycle of the organism (e.g. radiation, wounds, unhealthy food)

### Regulation 
- Stem cells are regulated by their local microenvironment
- Stem cells receive signals from surrounding cells 

### Stress response/resistance 
- Stem cells carry an intrinsic interferon gene signature (ISG) that protects it from viral infection 
	- This also makes them difficult to manipulate ex vivo 
![[Pasted image 20230405172935.png|400]]
- Stem cells are also resistant to chemotherapy 
	- Stem cells can repair DNA damage induced by chemotherapy, and regenerate tissues depleted by chemotherapy 
- Stem cells may be the "units of natural selection for tissue formation, germ line development, and cancer development" 
	- This may make them major targets for cancer initiation due to muttaion 
		- E.g. oncogenes or tumour suppressor genes are expressed selectively in some tissue-specific stem cells but not others 

## Cancer stem cells vs stem cells 
Pretty much the same, except that CSCs may not differentiate

# Testing self-renewal in cancer 
## Isolation of CSCs for testing 
1. Physical removal of tumour 
2. Separate out the cells and suspend cells in an in vitro culture 
3. Cell sorting
4. Test different fractions for self-renewal ability to detect CSCs

## Experimental techniques to prove self-renewal 
- **Non-adherent sphere assay**. Stem cells should have the capacity to form a sphere in liquid culture; differentiated cells do not have this capacity. 
- **Colony forming assay**. Stem cells should be able to form colonies on matrigel. 
- **In vivo Tx assay**. Cells should be able to form a tumour ex situ (i.e. when transferred from one individual to another)

# Models of tumour heterogeneity 
### Clonal evolution model (stochastic)
A normal differentiated cell acquires a mutation that confers a selective growth advantage. Some descendants of this cell are similarly tumourigenic, while others are not, and selection occurs for the tumourigenic cells. This results in a stochastic organisation because cells that are proliferative or not proliferative are determined by randomly acquired mutations. In this model, heterogeneity is generated by clonal expansion, diversification, and subsequent selection. 
![[Pasted image 20230405173905.png|550]]

### Cancer stem cell model (hierarchical)
A cancer stem cell exists that can self-proliferate and differentiate, giving rise to cancer. Only a subset of the cancer cells are stem cells (i.e. they are rare) and can regenerate a tumour on its own. This results in a hierarchical organisation because non-proliferative cells are derived from a cancer stem cell. In this model, heterogeneity is generated due to cells being at different stages of differentiation. 
![[Pasted image 20230405174019.png|600]]

## Testing the models
To prove the cancer stem cell model, we need to find a subset of cells that give rise to all other cells in the tumour, and is sufficient to regenerate the tumour. ![[Pasted image 20230405174246.png]]
## Evidence for CSC model 
- #experimental_evidence Lapidot (1994) – Cells were purified from human leukaemia by FACS for a stem cell surface phenotype. Specifically, cells that expressed CD34<sup>+ve</sup> and CD38<sup>-ve</sup>. When these cells were injected in immunodeficient mice, it reinitiated leukaemia in the mice. The frequency of these cells was <1 in 250 000 cells. ![[Pasted image 20230405174544.png]]
- #experimental_evidence Bonne & Dick (1997) – showed that leukemia initiating cells in immunodeficient mice differentiated in vivo into leukemic blasts, indicating that leukemic clone is organised as a hierarchy 

## Evidence against CSC model 
- #experimental_evidence Kelly (2007) – Unsorted cells from primary Eμ-myc pre-B/B lymphomas, Eμ-N-RAS thymic lymphomas, or PU.1<sup>-/-</sup> acute myeloid leukaemia (AML) mice models were transplanted into non-irradiated congenic mice. When just 10 unsorted cells were transplanted, it still resulted in tumour development. If CSCs are indeed rare, it is unlikely that one would have been picked up in just a 10 cell sample. 
	- Congenic = Differ in only one locus and a linked segment of chromosome are defined as congenic
	- #question Why is it important that the mice are congenic? 

## Reconciling the evidence
- **Species cross-reactivity**. Lapidot (1994) transplanted human tumour cells into mice. This may select for human cells that can flourish in mice. 
- **Atypical environment.** The experiments did not take into account the regulatory effects of bystander cells. 
- **Technical bias in how cells were isolated**. Isolating cells requires the cells to survive collagenase digestion (to separate them from ECM), 20°C, high oxygen tension, sorting process, and being in ectopic environments. This may select for cells that are not representative of the actual cancer tissue.  
- **Tumour initiation is not tumour maintenance**. Xenograft assays examine tumourigenic **potential** rather than cell fate. 
- **Different cancers may follow different models**. E.g. Leukaemias may have CSC model, while lymphomas are clonal evolution model? 
- **Differing sources of cancer cells**. Lapidot (1994) used cancer cells derived from a human, while Kelly (2007) used transgenic mouse models. These transgene driven mouse cancer models do not accurately recapitulate human tumour complexity, as there is overexpression of potent oncogenes in many cells. 

## In some cancers, both models can be seen
![[Pasted image 20230405225036.png]]
- Elements of both models can contribute depending on cancer type or stage of tumour development 
- It could be that a stage of clonal evolution occurs to select for cells with stem cell-like properties (stochastic), upon which these CSCs give rise to other cells (hierarchical) ![[Pasted image 20230405230324.png|600]]

### Evidence for hybrid model in B cell chronic leukaemia (CLL)
E.g. in B cell chronic leukaemia (CLL), both hierarchical tumour model and clonal evolution are seen
![[Pasted image 20230405224510.png]]
- #experimental_evidence Seifert et al (2012) – showed that CD5+ differentiated B cells can give rise to CLL by comparing the transcriptomes of CLL cells with normal cells 
- #experimental_evidence Kikushige et al (2011) – showed that hematopoietic stem cells can give rise to CLL. They transplanted HSCs from CLL patients into mice, and found that they developed monoclonal or oligoclonal B cells which is a precursor stage to CLL development. 

# Cell of Origin of CSCs
- Cancer stem cells must have arisen from normal cells. These normal cells are termed the "cell-of-origin" (COO). 
- The COO is the cell that acquired the first driver mutation (pre-cancerous)
- The COO can be a stem cell or a downstream cell, depending on the turnover dynamics of the tissue and the effect of the mutation 
![[Pasted image 20230405224200.png]]
 
> [!warning] Take Note!
> The Cell of Origin is a distinct concept from that of cancer stem cells. COO denotes a **normal cell** that acquired the first driver mutation in the tumour, and originates all other cells in the tumour. If the COO is a stem cell, then it can directly be transformed into a CSC. If the COO is a more committed cell, it could acquire more mutations that allow it to gain the ability to self-proliferate and differentiate, and also act as a CSC. 

## Significance 
- The cell of origin can determine the tumour type and the aggressiveness of the tumour 

## Identifying COO 
### Comparing cell surface phenotype of cancer initiating cells with normal cells 
- #experimental_evidence Bonne & Dick (1997) – Reported that normal hematopoietic stem cells are the cell of origin for leukemic stem cells. 
	- Sorted AML cells using flow cytometry and transplanted fractions into SCID mice to see if they could initiate human AML in the mice
	- These cells had properties of stem cells, suggesting that they were cancer stem cells 
		- Able to differentiate – mice transplanted with AML-M4 cells showed evidence of myeloblastic and monoblastic differentiation based on histological analysis 
		- Able to self-renew – via serial transplantation of SL-ICs. Transplanted AML cells into a primary mouse recipient, quantified the number of SL-ICs. After 6 weeks, remove the bone marrow cells, sort, and transplant sorted cells into secondary mouse recipient. Cells could initiate leukaemia -> self-renewal 
	- The cell surface phenotype of these cells were exclusively CD34<sup>++</sup>CD38<sup>-</sup>, which is similar to those of normal stem cells 
- #experimental_evidence Bonne & Dick (1997) were contradicted by later studies in larger patient cohorts which found many cases where LSCs had CD38+ or CD34- phenotypes, which are more similar to more differentiated progenitors. Transgenic mouse models also demonstrate conversion of committed progenitors into LSCs, so they *gained* self-renewal rather than having it in the first place. 

### Lineage tracing 
- Express oncogene and Cre recombinase in a tissue-specific manner (using tissue-specific promoter)
- Oncogene is activated and Cre recombinase KOs a tumour suppressor 
- By doing these "oncogenic hits" on different cell types, and seeing if they form a tumour, can see which cell type is the cell of origin. 
- Also, if the cell has an incorporated marker gene (e.g. LacZ), then all descendant cells will have the marker, allowing us to trace back the lineage 
- #experimental_evidence Barker et al (2009) used lineage tracing to show that colonic stems cells can act as the cell of origin for colon cancer.
