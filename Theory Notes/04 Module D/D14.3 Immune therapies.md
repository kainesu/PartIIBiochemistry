# What are immune therapies? 
Immunotherapies aim to boost the patient's immune response to tumours. 
- Tumour microenvironment contains immune cells with pro-and anti-tumour properties  
	- "Good players" are CD8 T, Th1, NK cells
	- "Bad players" are Treg, MDSC, M2 
- Immunotherapy involves boosting these "good players" and depleting "bad players"
- Immune cells receive many signals, some that are stimulatory and some that are inhibitory. Immunotherapy aims to modulate these signals to achieve the desirable immune response 

> [!example] Immunotherapy examples
> **Depleting bad players**
> - Sunitinib – decreases MDSCs and Tregs, blocks VEGF signalling

# Checkpoint inhibitors
## Principle 
- T cells can become inactivated after some time due to co-inhibitory signals – this is also called an immune checkpoint 
- Normally, immune checkpoints help to prevent excessive immune response which could lead to autoimmune disease 
- However, these checkpoints also allow cancer to escape T cell attack. Checkpoints tend to be activated in the tumour microenvironment as the T cells are chronically exposed to antigen 
	- We want the T cells to become "autoimmune" against the cancer cells 
- Checkpoint inhibitors help to prevent this by blocking these co-inhibitory signals, allowing the cytotoxic T cells to continue attacking the tumour cells 

## Anti-CTLA-4 therapy
- After a T cell is activated via TCR + CD28 engagement, CTLA-4 translocates to the cell surface and outcompetes CD28 for binding to the  costimulatory ligands CD80 (B7-1) or CD86 (B7-2) on APC. This interaction terminates the antigen-specific proliferative response 
- Tregs also express CTLA-4 in higher levels than CD8 cells 
- Hence, anti-CTLA-4 therapy can induce T cell proliferation and cause Treg apoptosis as they express CTLA-4 at higher levels than CD8 cells 

**Examples**
- ipilimumab
- tremelimumab 

## Anti PD1- therapy 
- When TCR is activated, IFNγ is produced by the T cell 
- IFNγ leads to expression of PD-1 ligands, PD-L1 and PD-L2, on the surface of APCs (including cancer cells) via JAK1/2 and STAT1 
- Interaction between PD-1 and its ligand results in immune checkpoint signalling
- PD-L1 can also interact with the costimulatory B7-1 (CD70) on T cells, resulting in an inhibitory signal 
- PD-1 induces tyrosine phosphatase SHP-2 to dephosphorylate signalling molecules downstream of TCR, thus inactivating the T cell 
- Chronic exposure of T cells to cognate antigens thus triggers reactive PD-L1 expression by the target cells. This continuous PD-1 signalling in T cells induces T-cell exhaustion 
- Tumour cells can express PD-L1, resulting in checkpoint activation 
- Tregs also express PD-L1 

**Examples**
- Nivolumab

> ![[Pasted image 20230526180058.png]]

## Combination therapies
- CTLA-4 and PD-1 blockade are non-redundant and showed synergy in syngeneic mouse models, so combining the two could be helpful 
- Checkpoint blockade could also be combined with other therapies that help to overcome acquired resistance to checkpoint blockade 
	- Inject interferon-inducing molecules (e.g. toll-like receptor agonists, oncolytic viruses)
	- Block T-cell excluding proteins (e.g. IDO, arginase)
	- Inhibit immune suppressive cells (e.g. Tregs, macrophages)
	- Other modes of therapy could change tumour microenvironment, e.g. oncogene-targeted therapies, chemotherapies, etc. 

## Advantages
- PD-1 blockade has been particularly effective in Hodgkin's lymphoma due to constitutive expression of PD-L1 via amplification of PD-L1 and PD-L2 loci 
- PD-1 blockade also effective in virally-induced cancers (e.g. Merkel cell carcinoma of the skin) and carcinogen-induced cancers (e.g. melanomas, NSCLC, bladder cancer, urothelial cancer, gastroesophageal cancer, etc.) 
- Tumours with higher mutational burden are more likely to respond to checkpoint blockade (e.g. microsatellite-instability cancers)
- Rate of relapse is lower than other treatments, resulting in a more durable tumor response 
- Patient stratification by diagnosing for biomarkers could identify patients who could best respond to PD-1 blockade. We should look for 
	- Tumours with high mutational load and absence of deleterious mutations in immune signalling pathways (DNA sequencing)
	- Presence of IFNγ signalling (RNA sequencing)
	- Presence of PD-1 expressing CD8+ cells (FACS?)

## Disadvantages
- Anti-CTLA-4 has low overall efficacy in tumours with high burden (i.e. high load)
- Checkpoint inhibition is more effective for cancers with pre-existing T cell infiltration. This could be due to the cancer having low immunogenicity, such as from a lack of mutations that are recognised as antigens, or by actively excluding T cells 
- Immunosuppressive cells in the tumour microenvironment could reduce effectiveness of checkpoint blockade e.g. MDSCs, Tregs 
- Checkpoint inhibition may not be effective if the correct checkpoint is not inhibited (e.g. if T cell impaired by CTLA-4, don't use PD-1 blockade?)
- Cancer immunoediting may result in the loss of mutations that are most immunogenic, or decreased expression of genes involved in antigen-presentation pathway (i.e. cancer evolves)
	- E.g. loss of function mutations in β2-microglobulin (β2M), the required subunit for surface expression of MHC class I
	- E.g. JAK1/2 mutations – JAK1/2 are involved in IFNγ signalling pathway. If IFNγ cannot be detected, cancer will not express PD-L1, making PD-1 blockade useless 
		- IFNγ also induces expression of antigen-presenting machinery, production of chemokines, and is antiproliferative. So JAK1/2 mutation is also beneficial in preventing these effects. 
- Anti PD1 inhibition-triggered hyperprogression (i.e. explosive growth of the tumour), due to MDM2 amplification 
- Response to PD1 therapy depends on the gut microbiome, which we don't know much about 
- May have toxic side effects due to tissue-specific inflammation, e.g. enterocolitis, hepatitis, dermatitis, etc., although use of cortiscosteroids or other immune suppression methods controlled these symptoms without loss of anti-tumor activity. Single agent PD-1 pathway blockade otherwise has a relatively favourable level of toxicity. 
- May not be effective in patients who are already immunocompromised e.g. patients with HIV (?) 

# CAR cells
## Principle 
- Adoptive T cell transfer = infusion of lymphocytes 
- CAR = chimeric antigen receptor
- CARs are fusion proteins consisting of consisting of a single chain variable fragment (scFV) derived from the variable heavy and variable light chains of an antibody, linked to an intracellular signalling domain derived from T cell signalling proteins (CD3ζ). This domain activates the T-cell when the antigen is bound to scFV. 
- Immune cells taken from the patient (autologous T or NK cells) are genetically engineered to express CARs , which is linked to an intracellular signalling domain. 
	- 1st generation CARs have scFV, a transmembrane region, and the CD3ζ chain (signalling domain of TRC complex), which provides 1 signal to the T cells
	- 2nd generation CARs additionally have 1 co-stimulatory domain (CD28 or 4-1BB) 
	- 3rd generation CARs have 2 costimulatory domains 

![[Pasted image 20230412172301.png]]

## Choosing antigen for CAR cells 
**Good target**
- CD19 in B cell malignancies 
	- Frequently expressed at a high level on B cell surface -> efficacy  
	- Not expressed outside of B cell lineage -> selective AND dispensable (B cells not essential for survival of patient since they can be replenished)
	- Required for normal B cell development in humans 
	- Liquid tumour -> easy to access 
- Targets in hot tumours – less immunosuppressive TME e.g. melanomas
- Neoantigens 

**Bad target**
- HER2 
	- Expressed on tumour cells (e.g. breast) and also normal lung epithelium -> not selective 
- Carbonic anhydrase IX (CAIX)
	- Expressed on renal cell carcinoma but also at a low level on normal biliary epithelium -> not selective 
- Targets in cold tumours e.g. pancreatic cancer

## Timing 
- Immunotherapy generally more successful during early cancer stages 
- Do it after depleting immunosuppressive cells e.g. with chemo or antibodies targeting immunosuppresive cells 
- Don't add checkpoint blockade + CAR-T. If CAR-T already engineered to have a certain level of immune response, don't add blockade or excessive immune response may result (cytokine storm)
- It also doesn't make sense to add blockade at same time as CAR-T as CAR-T not exhausted. Could add it later on if exhausted (check first) cos maybe they are not exhausted yet 

## Advantages
- The CAR can be designed to target a specific antigen and with high binding affinity 
- Unlike TCRs, CARs allow the cells to target an extracellular antigen **independent of the peptide-HLA complex**, allowing the cells to target cancer cells even if they downregulate HLA expression to evade immune response. This is a common mechanism of immunoevasion. 
- Co-stimulatory domains included in the CAR construct (e.g. CD28) can improve T cell activation and persistence, allowing for a more robust immune response, and also remove the need for costimulation. 
- Can be combined with other immunotherapies 

## Drawbacks 
- Poor solid tumour infiltration – tumour stroma and immunosuppresive TME blocks penetration and mobility of CAR-T cells 
	- Could modulate tumour stroma by engineering CAR-T cells to secrete enzymes that degrade ECM, e.g. heparanase 
- Not effective in immunosuppressive TMEs (e.g. TAMs, Tregs, MDSCs, see [[D13 Tumour microenvironment#Cancer and immune response|Cancer and immune response]]) – "cold tumours"
	- Immune checkpoint expression 
	- Hypoxia 
	- Expression of IDO, arginase 
	- Remove immunosuppressive cells
		- Administer CAR-T with all-trans retinoic acid to reduce MDSCs
		- Use chemotherapy to deplete immune cells generally 
		- Mutate LCK-binding motif of CD28 intracellular domain of CAR-T cells to make them resistant to suppression by Tregs 
- Tumour-antigen escape – tumour cell loses target antigen expression 
	- E.g. in CAR-T therapy against CD19 leukemia, the cancer cells loss the antigenic epitope on CD19 targeteed by the CAR-T
	- This might be overcome by targeting multiple epitopes, e.g. CD22 in addition to CD19 with bispecific CAR-T cells 
	- Or engineer CAR-T cells to produce [[D14.3 Immune therapies#BiTE/BiKE|BiTEs]] to link the T cell to the tumour cell 
- Lack of CAR-T persistence e.g. in chronic lymphocytic leukemia 
- Lack of specific markers
- Cytokine-release syndrome ("cytokine storm")
	- Could be combatted with immune suppressors e.g. corticosteroids
	- Or delete cytokines associated with CRS 
		- E.g. Deletion of GM-CSF in CAR-T cells improved its antitumor activity in mice 
		- IL-1 secretion by macrophages shown to contribute to CRS, so could engineer CAR-T to secrete IL-1 receptor antagonist 
- Neurological toxicities 
- On-target off-tumor effects – solid tumor antigens are often expressed on normal tissues at varying levels, so antigen selection is crucial in CAR design
	- Solid tumours particularly lack tumor-specific cell-surface antigens 
	- Varying the binding affinity could be helpful in discriminating between the targets on the tumour, which ideally should be highly expressed on the tumour, and targets off the tumour, which should ideally be less expressed. If the binding affinity is not too high, then the CAR should preferentially target to the tumour. But difficult to determine optimal affinity for selectivity. 
	- Or use target multiple epitopes in tumour 
	- Or use synthetic Notch receptor (conditional CAR)
- CARs require extracellular surface targets on the tumor cell 
- Expensive as it has to be customised for each patient 
	- Using immune cells from another patient could result in the endogenous TCR on the infused CAR-T cells recognised major and minor histocompatibility antigens in the recipient, which would result in graft-versus-host-disease (GVHD). 
	- Universal CAR-T derived from healthy donors could obviate the need to use T cells from the patient, making CAR-T therapy cheaper 
- Few preclinical models to evaluate safety, efficacy 

## CAR variants 
- Eliminate co-inhibitory receptors on the CAR cells e.g. CTLA-4, PD-1  
- Eliminate genes also expressed by T cells via gene editing 
- Improving selectivity of CARs 
	- Split CD3ζ and costimulatory signals into two separate chimeric receptors 
	- Synthetic Notch receptor system: CAR1 receptor binds to ligand, triggering proteolysis of an intracellular domain of Notch receptor. This releases a transcriptional regulator that activates expression of gene encoding CAR2. This leads to expression of CAR2 to bind to a second antigen. This system ensures selectivity by conditioning CAR expression on binding of the first CAR. ![[Pasted image 20230526194751.png|500]]
- Design a degron into the CAR protein that is targeted by a protease. In the "on" state, the degron is cleaved off by the protease, allowing the CAR is expressed on the cell surface. Administering a protease inhibitor keeps the degron on the CAR, and the CAR is targeted for proteasomal degradation, turning it "off"
- **Armoured CARs**: CAR cells engineered to secrete immunostimulatory cytokines (e.g. IL-2, IL-15, IL-12) to be resistant to immunosuppression via PD1/CTLA4 deletion 
	- Engineer CAR-Ts to express a PD-1 receptor that lacks signalling domain. This binds to PD-L1, but does not transduce inhibitory signals. This was found to improve antitumor effect of CAR-T in mesothelioma xenograft 
- **Self-destructing CARs**: Suicide switches by caspase 9 expression 
	- Caspase-9 fused to a domain of FKBP12 (inducible caspase-9, or iCasp9). When a small molecule (e.g. rimiducid), FKBP12 domains of caspase-9 dimerise, and T cells undergo apoptosis 
- **Self-driving CARs**: CAR cells engineered to express chemokine receptors to enhance trafficking into tissue and homing to tumour cell
	- E.g. co-expression of CC-chemokine receptor 2 (CCR2), a receptor for CCL2, shown to improve trafficking to xenograft model of neuroblastoma
- **Universal CAR:** Manufacture of CARs is simplified by removing HLA molecules and endogenous TCR 
	- But removal of HLA molecules could lead to targeting by NK cells 
		- Maybe only insert HLA-E and delete HLA-A, B and C 
	- NK92 cell line developed – allogeneic NK cells are safer to infuse even without complete HLA matching due to absence of TCR. But they have lower persistence 

# Immune cell engagers (ICEs)
- ICEs target immune effector cells to attack cancer cells, whether or not they have receptors specific to cancer antigens 
- ICEs consist of bispecific (or even trispecific) antibodies. Two single chain variable fragment (scFvs) from two different monoclonal antibodies are combined. One scFV targets a tumour antigen, while the other binds to a membrane molecule on the effector immune cell. Thus, ICEs bring the immune effector and cancer cell together, allowing for an immune synapse to form no matter the antigen specificity of the immune cell 
- ICEs can also cause the death of nearby cells that do not express the target antigen ("bystander killing effect"). Cytokine diffusion causes upregulation of cell surface molecules (e.g. ICAM-1, FAS) on bystander cells that make them easier to kill by effectors

## BiTE/BiKE
- Bispecific cell engagers bring T/NK cells close to target and capture them with high binding affinity
	- E.g. Blinatumomab is a BiTE that targets a tumour antigen CD19 on B cells and an activating receptor CD3 on T cells. Had benefit for acute lymphoblastic leukemia patients 

## TrinKET/TriKE
- Tri-specific killer engager brings three cell types together, or two types and cytokines
	- E.g. DF1001 is a HER2 tri-specific cell engager that binds HER2, NK, and delivers IL-15 

# Patient specific cancer vaccines 
- Sample tumour, blood (assumed to be non-cancerous) and identify antigens only expressed in the tumour
- Use antigen to develop vaccine 
- Epitope spreading can occur after vaccination, where T cells are generated against other epitopes in the same antigen 
- But very expensive 

# Considerations for choice of immunotherapy 

| Tumour characteristics    | Characteristics of TME                        | Immunotherapy strategies                                                                                                                       |
| ------------------------- | --------------------------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Hot – neoantigens present | CD8+ T cell infiltration, but TME suppressive | Checkpoint blockade, introduce co-stimulatory signals, remove immunosuppressive cells                                                          |
| "Tepid" – intermediate    | T cells not infiltrated efficiently           | Angiogenesis, stromal modification to improve T cell infiltration. Or use combination therapies to improve activity of the few T cells present |
| Cold – few neoantigens    | T cells absent                                | Oncolytic viruses, ADCs, vaccines, CAR cells                                                                                                   |

# General limitations of immunotherapy 
- Some rare proteins (e.g. only transiently expressed in early embryonic development) may never be exposed to immune system
- Immunoprivileged tissues e.g. brain, germ cells in testes, are not accessible to immune cells

# Combination therapies
[[VannemanDranoff_2012]]

## Combining targeted therapy with immunotherapy 
Targeted therapies and immunotherapy are highly complementary approaches
- Targeted approaches inhibit pathways for tumour growth and maintenance
- Immunotherapies target tumour microenvironment and stimulate host immune response for long-lasting tumour treatment

![[Pasted image 20230526230248.png]]

- Increase antigen presentation by dendritic cells to enhance activation of CTLs
	- Monoclonal antibodies can facilitate uptake of tumour antigens by DCs apart from attenuating oncogenic signalling 
		- Trastuzumab -> HER2 
		- Cetuximab -> EGFR 
	- Combine with cancer vaccines (e.g. HER2 peptide vaccine) -> produce antigens for presentation 
	- JAK2 inhibitors augment DCs by blockading STAT3 signalling involved in immunosuppression 
- Maintain activation of T cells
	- mTOR inhibition 
		- "In a lymphocytic choriomeningitis virus (LCMV) mouse model of acute viral infection, animals treated with **rapamycin** showed an increased early expansion of CD8+ virus-specific T cells, increased effector-to-memory T cell differentiation, and enhanced re-activation, function and survival of memory T cells"
		- Temsirolimus (rapamycin derivative) + vaccination with HSP90 adjuvant and the tumour antigen gp100 inhibited tumour growth in B16 melanoma mouse models 
		- mTOR inhibitor AZD8055 + agonistic CD40 antibody improved CD8+ T cell activity and infiltration in metastatic (!) renal cancer 
	- However, mTOR inhibition could expand Treg population as well, so timing of mTOR inhibition is important 
	- Antagonists of inhibitor of apoptosis proteins (IAPs) can act as co-stimulatory agents 
- Sensitisation of tumour cells to immune attack 
	- Bortezomib is a proteasome inhibitor that was designed to cause accumulation of misfolded proteins, triggering UPR in tumour cells. But this also decreases peptide loading and MHC I expression due to decrease in proteasome activity -> NK cell susceptibility 
		- Also increases tumour cell expression of FAS and TRAIL -> NK cell susceptibility 
		- Bortezomib + HPV E7-based vaccine had longer response in preclinical model of HPV-induced disease
	- BRAF inhibitor Vemurafenib enhances expression of several T cell target antigens, e.g. gp100, TYRP1, MART1 
		- MART1 and gp-100 specific T cells had increased responsiveness to melanomas treated with BRAF inhibitors 
		- should balance against the effect of upregulating ERK activity though... 
	- Chemotherapy can trigger release of "danger" molecules from tumour cells and increase expression of death receptors 
- Promote differentiation of T cells into memory cells 
	- GSK3β is a component of WNT signalling pathway. Inhibiting GSK3β found to promote differentiation of T cells to a stem-cell like memory phenotype, which differentiated into central and effector memory T cells 
- Antibodies can facilitate NK-cell mediated antibody-dependent cellular cytotoxicity (ADCC) 
- Targeted therapies can cause tumour regression, which consequently decreases any tumour-associated immunosuppression, which would improve effectiveness of immunotherapies 
- Targeted therapies could break oncogene addiction, triggering tumour cell senescence to facilitate clearance by T cells
- Release of antigenic debris during tumour cell death could constitute an *in situ* vaccination 
- Attenuate activities of Tregs, MDSCs
	- Bevacizumab neutralises VEGFA, which is immunosuppressive by blocking DC maturation and promoting MDSC expansion 
	- VEGFR inhibition by sunitinib decreases numbers, function of MDSCs and Tregs 
	- Use chemotherapy to kill Tregs and MDSCs 

## Combining immunotherapies 
- Cancer vaccines to generate anti-tumour T cells + immune checkpoint blockade to prevent their exhaustion 
	- E.g. granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor (GM-CSF) secreting tumour cell vaccine + CTLA4 blockade
- Vaccine + blockade or co-stimulation 
	- HER2 + PD1/4-1BB antibodies 
- Combine blockade of multiple checkpoints
	- CTLA4 (ipilimumab) + PD1 blockade (nivolumab)
	- Targeting multiple checkpoints has synergy; e.g. combination of mAbs targeting CTLA-4 and PD-1 had better outcomes in mouse models than either blockade alone 
- Provide co-stimulatory signal + block co-inhibitory signal 
	- 4-1BB agonistic antibodies + CTLA-4 blockade 
- Combine CAR-T + co-stimulatory signals + block co-inhibitory signals 
- ADCC + blockade or co-stimulation 
	- E.g. anti-HER2 + blockade 

## Challenges 
- Timing, dosage, and sequencing of treatments is important 
- Some targeted therapies can have both immunostimulatory and immunosuppressive activities 
	- E.g. HSP90 inhibitors can increase CTL activity by enhancing antigen presentation on MHC I, but they also decrease some macrophage and DC functions
	- E.g. mTOR inhibitors
		- "mTOR inhibitors may expand the population of TReg cells when given before an immune stimulus, such as a vaccine, whereas continuous mTOR inhibition after immune stimulation may impede both TReg cells and effector T cells equally. Furthermore, release of mTOR inhibition after tonic blockade may cause a rapid rebound in the TReg cell population."
- Avoiding toxicity 
	- Many immunotherapies cause inflammation, and combining complementary immunotherapies (i.e. affect different parts of immune response) may increase likelihood of inflammation 
	- However, some preclinical studies found that some combination treatments (e.g. CTLA4 + 41BB) could diminish inflammation 

### Optimum timing of combination therapies
1. Therapies that target DC priming to pre-treat patient before immunotherapies 
	1. e.g. sunitinib then vaccination better than giving them together 
	2. or pretreatment with mAbs to enhance phagocytosis of tumour antigens by DCs for priming 
	3. during this time, avoid therapies that could antagonise DC function 
2. Vaccinate 
3. CAR-T cells 
4. Checkpoint blockade and co-stimulatory activators to maintain T cell activation and prevent exhaustion 
5. Promote T cell differentiation e.g. GSK3β inhibitors, mTOR inhibitors

Therapies that antagonise immunosuppressive TME could be applied throughout the treatment course.
