# Analysing the question 
- Discuss = provide a viewpoint. 
	- What extent is this true, or to what extent we understand, or what are the important experiments that helped us understand, what do we not understand yet

# Question archetypes 
- Discuss techniques – organise by research question
- Discuss mechanisms 
- Discuss uncertainties e.g. "how far do we understand..."
	- Organise by RESEARCH QUESTION, then for each question, explain in a logical order what we know/don't know. Don't separate the know/don't know, but put them together if they apply to the same topic sentence. E.g. In biosynthesis of xylan, the genes needed backbone synthesis have been found, but we are still clear on their exact function as they have not been characterised biochemically.
- Discuss how you would investigate 
	- In silico, in vitro, in vivo 
	- Biochemical, genetic, structural, phylogenetic studies 
	- Differences across space, time 
	- Organise by research question! 
	- Include **suitable controls** 

# Originality points
- Add in your personal comments or opinions! 
- Synthesis, distill the key principles 

## Techniques 
- Vital assumptions/limitations of the technique 
- Relating to other modules
	- Module A: How can the technique be integrated with structural methods 
	- Module B/C: How can this technique be used to study other processes? 
- Future advancements in the field 
- Tinbergen's questions: How can it be used to study mechanism, function, development, phylogenetics 
- Suggesting your own experiments – difficult to do, but could suggest an increment from something you've already seen work (e.g. trying the same experiment on a new protein)

## Mechanisms 
- Future questions in the field
	- Have Tinbergen's 4 questions been answered? 
		- Mechanism: What is the series of molecular reactions that result in this phenomenon? How do the structures of the molecules involved contribute? How is it regulated? 
		- Function: What are the implications or consequences of this process for the cell? Why does it confer a fitness advantage to the cell? 
		- Development: How has this phenomenon developed during the lifetime of the individual? 
		- Phylogenetics: How has this phenomenon evolved? How is it conserved or diverged from other species? 
	- Relating to other modules
		- Module A: Can the process be studied with other methods 
		- Module B/C: How does this process integrate with transcription/localisation/chromatin/protein trafficking etc  
- Applications
	- Synthetic biology
	- Clinical 
		- Module D: Cancer 
		- Personalised medicine 
- Principles that can be generalisable
	- Heterogeneity
		- Across time (e.g. development)
		- Across space 
		- Context-dependence 
		- Hybrid models
	- Stochasticity 
	- Integrated systems -> cells should be studied from a systems-wide point of view, especially with the development of big data methods in biology 
		- Regulation and feedback 
		- Emergent properties 
	- Importance of structure-function relationships 
	- Biophysics – the use of energy to manipulate thermodynamics, kinetics in cells 
	- Evolution and natural selection 
	- Redundancy and robustness 
	- Modularity
	- Adaptation and homeostasis – biological processes are dynamic and respond to different stimuli 
	- Cooperation and competition 
	- Information storage and transfer 
	- Specificity and affinity 
	- Organisation 
	- Rate limiting steps vs combinatorial factors in biological processes

# Novel questions 
- Novel questions can often be related to a surrogate question or broken down into multiple smaller questions that might be answered using previously known literature

> [!example] Developing therapeutics for metastasis 
> One possible question that could be seen in the Tripos is, "Why is it challenging to develop therapeutics for metastasis?"
> 
> We can break this question down further into: 
> - We don't understand metastasis well enough 
> 	- Why don't we understand metastasis well enough?
> 		- Current challenges in studying metastasis 
> 			- Disadvantages of model systems 
> 			- Intrinsic properties of metastasis 
> - Metastasis is resistant to therapy
> 	- Why is metastasis resistant to therapy? 
> 		- Properties of metastasis 

# Structure 
## Introduction 
- Have a **thesis statement** to guide the thread of your essay
- Not possible to discuss all relevant aspects in the space/time given at length, but can mention all points in intro/conclusion then say you are only going to focus on a few for X reasons 
- If in doubt about scope of essay, give rationale in introductory para 

## Body 
- Common thread that supports the thesis statement 
- Some essays not possible to have such a thread, so each para could have its own viewpoint
	- Fundamental themes
	- Major steps
	- Major breakthroughs
	- Highlight what is important 
- Have headings 
- Signpost what is the main point of each para at the start of the para 
- Provide extra reading, but balance between new material and providing a comprehensive answer to the question 
- Be detailed 
- LINK back to the question at the end of the para
