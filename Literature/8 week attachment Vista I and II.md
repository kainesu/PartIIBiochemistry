# 8 week attachment Vista I and II

Note type: Source
Source type: Talk

- Go broad, have strong basic foundation
- Try different labs, projects, to see what you like
- Do some reading — what are some of the current research activities in your environment and in other environments
- What are the emerging research areas?
- You need research experience to come up with a research topic
- Go with your **interests** and **strengths**
- A*STAR re[[Barstow_2023]]search interests are not necessarily aligned with economic/industry
    - new knowledge is needed to create translational applications in the first place
    - **Use-inspired basic research**
- IMCB, IMRE, GIS, SIgN does have basic research teams
- Take more courses
- Think about what science fields are related to your current interests to broaden your research interests! E.g. if you are interested in food science → nutrition → metabolomics?
    - Draw a mind map or sth lol
- In A*STAR, research is full-time, unlike in universities
- Universities hire globally — only the best of the best will be hired for academia
- Typical research topics are quite interdisciplinary
- Agri-food, infectious diseases, artificial intelligence, neuro-, social-, computational science, UTTO (urban and green tech — CCU, decarbonization), automation and robotics
- Overseas profs don't really know sg research environment — so talk to local mentors as well
- Networks are valuable — the more connections you have across different sciences, the better you can do your science, and the more valuable you become to organizations
- Before attending webinars ask yourself "what will I get out of it?" "How is this building towards career aspirations?"
- If you are interested in an area and you're not sure if A*STAR is engaged in that research, can email AGA and AGA can help direct you to DCE R (Prof Andy Hor), other relevant persons
    - Possible to work with uni
- Enhanced joint appt scheme
- Applying for PhDs is easy when you come with funding lol apparently
- When applying for PhD, contact professor in intended university
- reflect a lot — what are you interested in? What could you do for the rest of your career? What do you know about?
- Take advantage of AGA support to explore many different projects to better understand your interests
- Biocatalysis - enzymes
    - machine learning
    - high throughput experimentation
    - changing enzymes without experiments — to improve enzyme engineering speed
- You can write directly to councils to match you to interested areas![[Untitled 8.png]]

Questions for EDs

- some topics are "trendy" and eaasier to find mentors, funding, etc., while other topics are less studied but might have more opportunities for new discoveries. is either more important or how can we balance between them?
- How did you explore and decide what research problems to work on?
- how important are networks in research and how can we build them?
- Mention about collaboration between SERC and BMRC — what are some examples?
- Is BMRC also involved in urban and green technology HTPO?
    - maybe? lol

**Common early career mistakes**

- Learn from your mistakes
- Recognize when to cut your losses or pivot away to another field
- don't be afraid to go into something you feel strongly about
- thinking that whatever you do for PhD is what you have to do for the rest of your life — PhD is training you how to think
    - Don't be afraid to switch subjects if you find something more interesting
    - You aren't stuck!
    - PhD is just the start of the training.
    - So don't feel like you're saddled with the PhD subject for the rest of your life
    

**How to identify research interests**

- Try to align your interests with Astar's mission
- Astar's mission is broad enough to fulfil many PhD interests
- Don't go with traditional areas and stick with one area alone. Challenge yourself: there is novelty at the interfaces between traditional disciplines
    - E.g. integrative social sciences track - computational and social sciences
- If it keeps you awake reading publications late in the night, perhaps this is the right project for you!
- Overcome your own fear of failure and imposter syndrome
    - E.g. You can do a PhD in immunology without a background in immunology! If you have a different background, that diversity of experience makes your perspective unique
- Eliminate what you like and don't like
- Transitioning from chemistry to physics? Pick an interdisciplinary physics subject that has some link to to chemistry, and there are things you can gradually pick up along the way

**Choosing an institute to do your research?**

- Area
- Broader impact of the research?
- Talk to the lab — good vibes?
    - if the phd students, scientists are all very quiet, seem fearful of the supervisor (lol?) this would be a red flag
    - Can you communicate well with the supervisor? A good relationship between student and supervisor is very important.
    - Fly-in visits are important
    - Are you comfortable in the environment of the lab?

**What to focus on in undergraduate studies?** 

- Take a mix of subjects — don't stick to one major, read beyond your major subject (multilingualism!)
    - We need to be resourceful enough to operate outside our boundaries
    

**PhD application advice**

- US and European process is quite different — programmes are different
- In US unis, first 1-2 years involves some coursework (sort of like a Masters background), and there are lab rotations to help you explore your research interests (somewhat like several 8 week RAs)
- UK has no lab rotation so you start lab work from the first day. Although it's possible to choose an interdisciplinary research lab

**How to choose a PhD programme**

- What is the supervisor's work style? Early career vs late career researcher
- Late career: suggests a few general ideas to study, then talk to the other people in the group.
    - Communication and talking to the people around you is important!
- 

## 8 Week RA

- Figure out what working style works for you in research — will help you with future projects that are longer
- Follow along with what the postdoc is saying, learn as much as you can by osmosis
- You choice of RA doesn't have to be the field you commit to, but think of it as exposure — go in with an open mind
- Joining a group from early career scientists vs late career is quite different — different expectations
- Ask for publications that are aligned with project to work on for background information
- Manage your expectations — you're probaby not going to achieve too much since it's a short time.
- Figure out what the lab is doing
- Learn to assess workplace dynamics in a lab — signs in which PI relates to post-docs, graduate students
    - Learn to differentiate what is said and what actually plays out in the lab dynamics
- Gain an appreciation of the resources, opportunities afforded to you as scholars
- Learn about your organization — attend seminars to broaden your perspective!
    - Helps you to learn about scientists in SG too
- Daily life: literature search, data analysis, experimentation
- Take opportunities outside of your immediate research activities. Attend networking oppportunities, webinars
    - Don't be shy just talk to ppl :)
- Try out different activities and attachment opportunities
- Choose your supervisors carefully — you need people who will give you opportunities and mentor you
- Be aware that colleagues may have preconceived notions of how scholars should behave
    - We have been granted a lot of opportunities
    - Be sensitive to the fact that your curiosity may be taken the wrong way lol
    - Learn how to work with such people! Work hard, be humble.
    - Different people are working for different reasons
- Talk to your friends in other research institutes
- If you face a research or technical problem, actively communicate with your colleague or supervisor. Talking things through might inspire you to find a solution
- You need to balance hands on and literature search — active literature search and keeping up to date with news articles is quite important

What are our research interests? 

Can I learn coding in Camb... or should I learn on my own. any courses? clubs? 

learn bioinformatics in camb? 

green technology and biology — heat stress biology? adapting humans, organisms for climate

bioinformatics for TGBE design... 

Learn experimental design 

don't accept ppl tampering with your stuff
