# Experiments

- Birds housed in house made of entirely non-magnetic materials
- Electromagnetic shielded cage
- Emlen funnels
- No directional information apart from magnetic field subjected to from electromagnetic coils
- Line funnels with scratch-sensitive paper – distribution of scratches informs us of bird's preferred orientation

# How does magnetic compass sense work?

- How it does **not** work: Magnetotactic bacterium – contain biogenic magnetite (Fe3O4) aligned within animal's body such that magnetic moments reinforce each other
    - Align with Earth's magnetic field
    - Magnetism used to orientate where is up and down – too small to use gravity
    - Live in shallow pools, so going to close to the surface → death
- Axial magnetic compass
    - If horizontal component or vertical component are reversed, bird's orientation is reversed
    - If both components are reversed, the bird's original preferred orientation is retained
- Light-sensitive: If birds tested in red, yellow, or darkness, they cannot orientate correctly

# Radical pair mechanism – cryptochrome

- The strength of the interaction between Earth's magnetic field and a radical pair is very small – smaller than thermal energy (Boltzmann constant x temperature)
- But there is a mechanism that could allow the interaction strength to be sufficient – radical pair mechanism
    - A small interaction can affect an unstable intermediate to go towards products.
    - If you have a high non-equilibrium state, it can be sensitive to tiny amounts of energy

- Conservation of spin momentum
- Singlet radical pair interconverts with a triplet – quantum mechanical process; oscillatory
- Yield of final product C contains information about magnetism experienced by the radicals
- Then you just need some way to interpret the yield, to interpret the magnetic field strength
- Directional dependence of radical pair mechanism

# Proof of concept for chemical compass

- Carotenoid-porphyrin-fullerene triad
- If you shine a light of the right wavelength, porphyrin absorbs the light, triggering
    - an electron transfer from porphyrin to fullerene
    - an electron transfer from carotenoid to porphyrin
- This creates a radical pair (one radical on carotenoid, one on fullerene)
- A weak magnetic field was able to affect the reaction of the molecule
- Aligning the molecule and varying the direction of the magnetic field also affected the *yield* → compass!

# Cryptochrome 4

- Proposed magnetoreceptor in birds – only known one with possible radical pair mechanism
- Chromophore – FAD
- Shining light of specific wavelength on cryptochrome triggers a series of electron transfers through a sequence of Trp residues to FAD
    - Trp – aromatic?
    - What about other aromatic residues e.g. Tyr, Phe
        - Phe does not do electron transfer; replacing Trp with Phe stops electron transfer
        - After mutating a Trp in position A, B, or C to Phe, radical pairs that formed were very short lived – too short to be sensitive to Earth's magnetic field
        - But mutating Trip in D to Phe produces radical pair with long enough longtime to be sensitive to a weak magnetic field such as the Earth's
- Electron spin resonance (like NMR but for electron spins) – measure distance between radicals in a radical pair by measuring their magnetic dipolar coupling
    - Interaction depends on inverse cube of distance between the radicals.
- The 4th electron transfer may be reversible, spending most time on Trp D rather than Trp C
    - Trp C may be more magnetically sensitive (being closer to FAD), while Trp D is closer to the surface and used for signalling
- Perhaps after formation of radical pair, the Trp radicals get reduced by some external electron donor in the solution → leaves protein with only FAD radical
    - Protein with FAD radical will have a different conformation in C domain → changes ability of cryptochrome to bind to other proteins → start of signal transduction cascade
- Experiment was successfully repeated in cryptochrome from non-migratory birds
    - Also showed response but weaker

- Production of cryptochrome changes seasonally in migratory birds but not in non-migratory birds
    - Cryptochrome produced more during migratory seasons

# Can birds actually see the Earth's magnetic field?

- Possible; we don't know what the bird perceives.
- A visual impression superimposed on the field of vision?
- Electromagnetic noise causes birds to become disoriented

# What we need to find out

- Do cryptochromes behave the same way *in vivo* and *in vitro*?
- How are the proteins immoblised and aligned in cells? (membranes?)
- Signal transduction pathway downstream of cryptochrome
- Are the magnetic field effects large enough?
- Nocturnal birds – is there enough light at night?

# Questions

- Coming from a chemistry background, what are some difficulties in working in an interdisciplinary area and do you think there are insights that could only be gained through interdisciplinary work (vs focusing on chemistry)
- How did you get the idea to apply your knowledge of chemistry to the study of orientation in birds?
    - How were you able to connect this idea of radical pair mechanism with magnetoreception in birds? Did your interest in avian magnetoreception inform your study of radical pair mechanism, or did your knowledge of this mechanism inspire you to apply it to avian magnetoreception?
- Electron transfer in plants? Magnetic?
- Evolution – did cryptochrome originally evolve for magnetoreception? Or were they exapted from some other function?
    - In humans, cryptochromes lack FAD and are involed in circadian rhythm
- Effect of residue arrangement on magnetoreception
    - Orientation and position of Trps are highly conserved – not just among migratory bird Cry4s but all avian Cry4s, and even Arabidopsis cryptochrome
    - Evolved to make electron transfer very efficient – right overlap of electorn donor and receiver
    - So changing the arrangement could likely affect magnetoreception but has not been investigated yet
    - Tyr has redox properties to produce radical pairs unlike Phe → different size so different arrangement if we replace Trp with Tyr
