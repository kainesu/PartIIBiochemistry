# The Architecture of the Rag GTPase Signaling Network

Project: TORC1 signalling
Source type: Journal

- TOR proteins are Ser/Thr kinases
- TORC1 is controlled by multiple pro-growth signals, though amino acids alone are sufficient as cues alone to activate TORC1 in yeast via Rag GTPases
- Amino acid available → Gtr1^GTP/Gtr2^GDP → TORC1 activated
- Amino acid starved → Gtr1^GDP/Gtr2^GTP → TORC1 inhibited
- Rag GTPases associate with EGO-TC in yeast which is anchored constitutively to vacuolar membrane
- In yeast TORC1 is co-localised with Rag GTPases at vacuolar membrane constitutively no matter the amino acid availability
    - At vacuole membrane, TORC1 can integrate both cytosolic and vacuolar/lysosomal amino acid pools

# Regulators of Rag GTPases in yeast

- EGO-TC – platform that recruits Gtr1/Gtr2 to vacuolar membrane
- Vam6 – GEF for Gtr1
- SEACIT – consists of Npr2, Npr3, Iml1. Acts as GAP for Gtr1. Under starvation, Iml1 stimulates Gtr1 GTPase activity
    - Met favours SEACIT disassembly ⇒ prevents inhibition of Gtr1 → TORC1 remains activated
- SEACAT – consists of Sec13, Rtc1/Sea2, Mtc5/Sea3, Sea4. Inhibits SEACIT
- Lst4-Lst7 – acts as GAP for Gtr2 when starved cells are re-fed with amino acids
    - Accumulates at vacuolar membrane in amino-acid starved cells, disperses when cells are re-fed with amino acids
    - Binds Gtr1/Gtr2 weakly in absence of amino acids, but more strongly in amino acid-fed or re-fed cells
    - Activation of TORC1 leads to release of Lst4-Lst7 from the vacuolar membrane ⇒ feedback inhibition?
    - Met, Cys, Glu, Asn, Asp can be deaminated and converted to Glutamate/Glutamine → efficient at displacing Lst4-Lst7 complex from vacuolar membrane

# Amino acid control of TORC pathway

- Yeasts preferentially grow on high quality nitrogen sources such as arginine, asparagine, and glutamine, while they grow very poorly on the branched-chain amino acids leucine, isoleucine, and valine
- Branched chain aminotransferases control TORC1 by
    - interconverting Leu α-ketoisocaproate and leucine
    - controlling flux through TCA cycle via interaction with Aco1
- Amino acids shuttle across vacuolar membranes through amino acid permeases that function as H+ antiporters (in) or symporters (out) → distribution of amino acids between the two compartments is driven by the proton gradient
    - Not known how and which amino acids signal through v-ATPase
    - In yeast, v-ATPase acts upstream of Rag GTPases but controls TORC1 in response to pH in cytoplasm which is a proxy for quality, quantity of the available carbon source

# Other controls

- Glucose starvation downregulates TORC1, “but the role of Rag GTPases seems less influential”
- Amino acids may regulate TORC1 directly, independently of Rag GTPases
