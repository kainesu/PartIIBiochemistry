The authors suggest some of the merits of indigenous knowledge, whose traditional practices are more beneficial to environmental conservation compared to modern practices. As such, current discrimination against indigenous people may not only be unjust, but harmful to conservation efforts as well.

We should question what criteria should be used to determine whether intervention is needed. Intervention may speed up restoration, but what is the cost? I think the authors could have gone further to explain the decision making process behind interventions.

Intuitively it makes sense that in areas with otters, there would be less red abalone for harvest as harvesters would compete with sea otters. The authors note that in such areas where a predator competes with harvesting, multi-use may not be practical. But this also raises an interesting point on whether harvesting could replace the role of a predator in a particular ecosystem if the predator has a specialized enough diet that can be replaced by harvesting. 

> A widely cited hypothesis...is that species-rich communities are more resistant to invasion than species-poor communities...but the opposite has also been postulated – the 'invasional metldown' hypothesis. This argues that the rate of invasions will actually increase with time, partly because the disruption of native species promotes further invasions and partly because some invaders have facultative rather than negative effects on later arrivals.

These are not necessarily conflicting arguments, they may just apply to different communities under different conditions.

This is an important point to make. Conservation of ecosystems is ultimately dependent on the level of support from the local community. There has to be a belief among locals that the ecosystem is indeed threatened before action can be taken. 

With the Aichi biodiversity targets, one target relates to raising awareness of biodiversity among the public. 

This point also relates to another key point – if ecosystem health is a social construct, then whose perspective of ecosystem health should we be taking? Historically it seems that often, certain groups of people have had their perspectives ignored, even if they hold the most knowledge about the ecosystem. 

> At best, and given the political will, perhaps 6% of land area may eventually be provided protection...reserves have often been established on land that no one else wants. Areas of high species richness and distributions of endangered plant and animal species often overlap with human population centres.
> 

I suppose this reveals the main trade-off / challenge in species conservation: a lot of space is needed, and much of these spaces have competing demands. Land use prioritization is indeed a problem for many places, especially in cities, and in my view the priorities have more often than not been biased towards development rather than conservation. E.g. in Singapore 

> Two key principles here (for selecting areas for protection) are *complementarity* and *irreplaceability*.
> 

Complementarity would depend on the set of features defined for the candidate areas. It works because there are already existing areas that are being conserved, so conserving new areas that complement the present set would improve the diversity of protected areas as a whole. 

> Many of the new generation of marine protected areas are designed as multiple use reserves...conservation and sustainable use on land can often proceed hand in hand as long as the planning has a scientific basis and the negotiated objectives are clear.
> 

While this seems to run contrary to conventional wisdom in that human activity is a trade-off to environmental conservation, this is actually a sensible idea because increasing accessibility to nature areas could improve its protection. When people are able to use a space, there forms a sentimental attachment and cultural heritage is developed. Future attempts to clear the area would be met with greater resistance as there is now not just ecological, but also economic and cultural reasons for protection. Accessibility allows for more exposure to and hence a better appreciation of nature and biodiversity. 

> When it comes to conservation of species, biodiversity, or ecosystems, however, it is more difficult to assign economic value to the entities to be conserved.
> 

There is also an argument to be made that assigning economic value to a species is an overly clinical and human-centric activity. It seems unfair that we save species only when they are useful to us, when we are much of the reason why they are going extinct in the first place. However, for pragmatic reasons, assigning economic value could be helpful especially to financiers – governments and private business owners – in understanding the numerical trade-offs that arise from activities they fund.
