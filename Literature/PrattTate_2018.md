## Chemical challenge in CH4 oxidation 
> ==Breaking the carbon−hydrogen bond in the CH4 molecule== is the first obstacle faced by all CH4 mitigation approaches that are not based on avoiding CH4 production. (Pratt and Tate, 2018, p. 6086)

> ==substantial amount of activation energy is required== for its initiation. (Pratt and Tate, 2018, p. 6086)

> In CH4-rich gas such as biogas produced at landfills and in wastewater treatment systems, energy recovery from gas combustion is technically feasible and widely practiced.68−70 However, ==in gas streams that are <5% CH4 concentration, continuous thermal combustion of CH4 is not achievable== (Pratt and Tate, 2018, p. 6086)

## Methanotroph biology 
> all methanotrophs exhibit is their possession of the enzyme ==methane monooxygenase (MMO), which catalyzes CH4 oxidation to methanol==, thus beginning a series of biochemical oxidation reactions culminating in CO2 and H2O production (Pratt and Tate, 2018, p. 6087)

> Broadly, the ==methanotrophs are classified as three types== (1, 2 and X) with the primary distinction being the basis of formaldehyde assimilation: Type 1 use the ribulose monophosphate (RuMP) pathway, Type 2 use the serine pathway and Type X primarily use the RuMP pathway but also possess serine pathway capability. Broadly, Type 1 methanotrophs favor CH4-poor/O2-rich environments whereas Type 2 methanotrophs dominate in CH4-rich/O2 poor settings.92 Ultimately though, as noted by Strong et al.,95 ==differences between the main methanotroph classes are often nuanced and no one particular group of organisms has been isolated demonstrating notably superior CH4 oxidation capability to all others==. (Pratt and Tate, 2018, p. 6087)

## Soil-based biofilters 
> ==feasibility of using soil-based biofilters containing active methanotroph populations has been demonstrated== for mitigating substantial CH4 emissions from various sources, including landfills, and stored agricultural effluent.96−99 Earlier applications have also been reported for coal mine emissions (Pratt and Tate, 2018, p. 6087)

### Adding other things to methanotrophic soil enhances activity 
> ==materials other than soil, e.g., biochar,103 have been tested in filters for their capacity to enhance CH4 oxidation efficiency.== (Pratt and Tate, 2018, p. 6088)

> Brandt et al.104 demonstrated that ==using expanded vermiculite in biofilter packing media increased the active methanotroph biomass by a factor of 3, resulting in a corresponding 100% increase in CH4 oxidation efficiency== (Pratt and Tate, 2018, p. 6088)

## Biofertilisers 
> use of organic inputs to stimulate methanotrophy in agricultural soils and/or engineered systems has potential obstacles that need to be addressed. ==Long-term effects on CH4 oxidation efficiency are unknown and need testing==. Moreover, addition of organic amendments to soil as carriers of the targeted microorganisms entails the obvious problem of ==introducing more carbon into the soil that could be converted to CH4.== (Pratt and Tate, 2018, p. 6089)

> This limitation could be overcome by ==extracting isolates of the desired microorganisms and introducing them into the soil as blends with conventional or low-labile carbon fertilizers==. Successes in similar areas have already been made in the development of products referred to a “biofertilizers” that have been demonstrated to convey agronomic benefits to soils. (Pratt and Tate, 2018, p. 6089)

## Transgenic rice 
> Su et al.132 demonstrated CH4 reduction and crop yield benefits in rice crops via transgenic manipulation. ==Using a barley transcription gene, these authors observed significant increases in grain starch and a corresponding decrease in CH4 emissions coupled with a diminished soil methanogen community==. Lower root mass and root exudates in the soil rhizosphere were proposed as the mechanism responsible for the suppressed CH4 emissions (Pratt and Tate, 2018, p. 6089)

> ==farming-based abatement approaches are difficult to implement without adversely impacting crop production== (Pratt and Tate, 2018, p. 6089)

→ advantage of biochemical approach over other approaches! 

> ==transgenics approach is in its infancy. Many questions remain== relating to its widespread and long-term effectiveness in achieving CH4 mitigation as well as grain yield. (Pratt and Tate, 2018, p. 6089)

> assess the impacts of the technology on long-term soil (Pratt and Tate, 2018, p. 6089) function and productivity. (Pratt and Tate, 2018, p. 6089)

## Microbial fuel cells 
> ==In MFCs applied to CH4 emission sources, electricity production is achieved in tandem with decreased CH4 emission== as the bacteria responsible for current generation are able to outcompete methanogens for substrate. (Pratt and Tate, 2018, p. 6089)

> Wrighton et al.152 found that the bacterial phylum Firmicutes was instrumental in achieving high current output in MFCs. (Pratt and Tate, 2018, p. 6089)

> McAnulty et al.156 have successfully constructed a consortium that combines the metabolically engineered archaeal strain Methanosarcina acetivorans that produces methyl-coenzyme M reductase and grows on CH4 with Geobacter sulfurreduens and CH4-consuming sludge to generate a substantial electrical current from CH4. (Pratt and Tate, 2018, p. 6089)

## Production of commercially useful products 
> ==Mitigation of CH4 emissions can also lead to the production of useful environmentally friendly products==. An example is the production of ==PHA== (polyhydroxyalkanoate) in soil microorganisms exposed to a high CH4 source in a low nutrient environment (Pratt and Tate, 2018, p. 6090)

> can be used as feedstock for the manufacture of ==Bioplastic== products (e.g., children’s toys, food packaging). (Pratt and Tate, 2018, p. 6090)

> ==other biodegradable polymers== such as PHBs (polyhydroxybutyrate) and polylactic acid (PLAa from lactic acid) that can also be produced by methanotrophs from biogas (mostly composed of CH4 and CO2), but under carefully controlled conditions (Pratt and Tate, 2018, p. 6090)

> ==Commercial application is currently limited by the high cost of production==. (Pratt and Tate, 2018, p. 6090)

> ==a better understanding of the microbial processes involved is needed if the production of bioplastics and other products from these precursors is to be optimized and made economical.== (Pratt and Tate, 2018, p. 6090)

## Maturity spectrum of technologies 
> ==maturity spectrum== ranging from blue-sky concepts through to commercially practiced activities. (Pratt and Tate, 2018, p. 6091)

good term to use – maturity spectrum.

### Low maturity 
> Transgenic technologies for producing rice strains with inherently low CH4-emitting traits is a promising approach but is clearly in its infancy with validation of long-term benefits needed. (Pratt and Tate, 2018, p. 6091)

> use of waste CH4 emissions to feed microbial fuel cells, while an exciting concept, really needs development and verification to frame it as a viable mitigation technology. (Pratt and Tate, 2018, p. 6091)

> potential for soil-based methanotrophs to achieve GHG mitigation benefits through carbon sequestration (additional to CH4 oxidation) is real. (Pratt and Tate, 2018, p. 6091)

### Intermediate maturity 
> Floating CH4 biofilters technology has been successfully demonstrated in the field,98,99 but scaled-up, longer-term testing is needed. (Pratt and Tate, 2018, p. 6092)

> technology is particularly appealing as a low-cost alternative for small-scale CH4 emitting (Pratt and Tate, 2018, p. 6092)

> Several companies are manufacturing floating biofilter wetlands globally, mainly for attenuation of nutrient and odorous compounds (Pratt and Tate, 2018, p. 6092)

> suite of biofertilizer products containing plant growth promoting bacteria are available through government initiatives as well as private enterprises (Pratt and Tate, 2018, p. 6092)

### Greatest maturity
> Another novel CH4 mitigation technology that has seen recent commercial success is the development of bioplastics from waste CH4 streams. Mango Materials (http://mangomaterials.com/), established in 2010, is a US-based company that converts landfill-generated CH4 into biopolymers for applications in clothing and packaging industries (Pratt and Tate, 2018, p. 6092)

> Advances in molecular understanding of methanotrophs will undoubtedly improve the efficiency of initiatives such as this, and open the opportunity for similar enterprises to start up and prosper in the market place (Pratt and Tate, 2018, p. 6092)
