- Researchers have been awarded a grant to engineer scalable biological reactors that capture and oxidise methane 
	- Scalability would improve economic feasibility and efficacy 
- Reactors will use engineered, deep sea methanotrophic bacteria 
- Aim is to use bioreactors to capture methane at source, e.g. fracking sites, landfills
- Bacteria are anaerobic, so bioreactor has to contain an anaerobic region to allow for methane fermentation 
- Established refineries that convert methane into fuel are very expensive, and transporting methane to these refineries results in significant losses of methane to the atmosphere during transport
