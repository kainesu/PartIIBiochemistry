- There is some association between genetic variation and methylation
- Most studies only look at cis or disease-associated SNPs
- Chessboard plot
- meQTL SNPs
- Causal relationship between DNA methylation and BMI
- Summary-based mendelian randomization
- Whole genome bisulfite sequencing
- Asian genomic data is underrepresented

Gene editing and epigenetics? CRISPR + methylase 

**Challenges in studying methylation** 

- Biological dynamism — methylation changes throughout life
- Effect sizes are large in cancer but small in other diseases, so accuracy of method has to be high
- Methylation is tissue specific – whole blood often used as a surrogate
- Variable cellular compositions often required computational correction; single cell resolution could help

**Single cell**

- Pseudotime ****
- Methods for scWGBS rely heavily on manual manipulation → low throughput
- scWGBS libraries have lower alignment rates
- Bisulfite conversion hampered by DNA degradation
- Methylation sensitive restriction enzyme

WGBS vs MeDIP??
