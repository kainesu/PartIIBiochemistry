- All photosynthetic organisms capture energy at rate of 120 terawatts, which is 6x world power use. Over next 80 years, applied biology could build new sustainable energy infrastructure
	- Adesina et al (2017)
	- Ambition setting... think ambitiously + long term! 
- Importance of back of the envelope calculations 
- Applications of biology
	- Room temperature and pressure catalysis!

- But there are few microbes that exactly fit the bill for application in sustainable energy (i.e. doesn't need engineering) 
	- E.g. *Acidithiobacillus ferrooxidans*
- Engineered microbes need to be built by synthetic biology. 
- We know little about the microbes most well suited for these sustainable applications 
	- Most efforts were focused on studying a small handful of medically relevant model organisms e.g. E. coli, S cerevisiae, C elegans, zebrafish, mice -> we have ignored other species that could be useful
	- 30-40% of coding sequences in a genome sequenced today are of unknown origin ==> issues with genome annotation 
- Sustainable energy will drive demand for metals 
	- Rare earth metals – many different devices 
		- Not found in concentrated ores -> need to excavate large areas 
		- Chemically similar -> separation of individual lanthanides is very difficult, but we need pure sources for applications. 
		- No known molecules or substances with high selectivity for lanthanides 
	- Nickel – catalysts
	- Cobalt - batteries
		- Unsustainably mined, unethical. 
	- Pt group elements 
	- IEAA, role of critical minerals in clean energy transitions (2022)
	- Mg – carbon sequestration! (think Rubisco)
- Metal mining is also a geopolitical risk! -> metal mining shifting to China 
- How can new microbes be discovered for these applications? 

Look into catalytic issues... ACS Catalysis? 

# Rare earth metals
- Gluconobacter oxydanas can REE bioleaching
- Shewanella oneidensis can biosorb REE 
- But neither are good enough for industrial use; but we can engineer them? 
- Getting better understanding of genomes 
	- Whole genome sequencing 
	- Knockout sudoku for building knockout collections 10x cheaper and faster than other technologies 

what to look for in a PhD group
- high productivity 
- diversity – age, race, nationality, gender 
- mentorship experience
- mentorship style 

cf Chew Lab, Dupree lab! 

## Gluconobacter
- produces acid to increase bioleaching 
- *pst* slows acid production 
- *mgdh* and cofactors accelerates acid production 
- Modifying these genes can increase bioleaching 
- process modification 

## REE separation 
- Shewanella oneidensis can selectively biosorb REE (for separation)
- How to improve for industrial use? 
- Great binding selectivity isn't needed to purify an lanthanide, but need to feed it back repeatedly through column (cf error correction in protein trafficking); so improving selectivity by even a bit can shorten this process 
- Polysaccharides are involved in rare earth metal separation???? 

**Finding quicker ways of doing things** is a good research avenue haha 
(wait im interested in tech development like this too that is inspired by an application...)

lets look for more environmental issues to solve with biology!!!! 
outside of the obvious (carbon removal)

# Electromicrobial production of stuff

- i love his slide design lmao 
- electroactive microbes have high Faradaic efficiency
- No volatile intermediate
- What is the upper limit efficiency for such a microbe? Shockley-Quiesser limit. 
- Salimijazi et al (2020). Joule. 

Look at all parts of supply chain / process for biological innovation 
Structural biology investigations 

Some microbes swap calcium for lanthanide in enzyme in calcium poor soils 
Toxicity?
