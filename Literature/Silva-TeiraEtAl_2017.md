## Justification for removing methane from wastewater 
> Methane related to anaerobic waste and wastewater treatment is responsible for 2.8% of the world’ overall GHG emissions (Silva-Teira et al., 2017, p. 971)

> To diminish these GHG emissions, the dissolved methane present in anaerobically treated effluents should be eliminated (Silva-Teira et al., 2017, p. 971)

> methane as a carbon source for biological denitrification (Silva-Teira et al., 2017, p. 971)

## How methanotrophs convert methane 
> Aerobic methanotrophs are able to convert methane into oxidized species such as methanol, formaldehyde or acetate, compounds that are fully soluble in water. These methane oxidation products can be employed as a carbon source by heterotrophic denitrifying microorganisms in a subsequent reaction. This process is known as aerobic methane oxidation coupled to denitrification (AMO-D) (Silva-Teira et al., 2017, p. 971)

> In the absence of oxygen, specific, recently discovered microorganisms are able to couple denitrification to anaerobic methane oxidation (DAMO) (Silva-Teira et al., 2017, p. 971)

> This process can be carried out either using nitrite and DAMO bacteria (Candidatus Methylomirabilis oxyfera)or nitrate and DAMO archaea (C. Methanoperedens nitroreducens) (Silva-Teira et al., 2017, p. 971)

> A consortium of anammox, DAMO archaea and DAMO bacteria was discovered [15]. DAMO archaea were responsible for reducing nitrate into nitrite, and then anammox and DAMO bacteria competed for nitrite. In the long term, it seems that the anammox bacteria outcompete the DAMO bacteria and the latter tend to disappear (Silva-Teira et al., 2017, p. 971)

Not good for long term control.

> Unfortunately, these newly discovered DAMO microorganisms are characterized by extremely slow growth rates of approximately 1–2 weeks (Silva-Teira et al., 2017, p. 971)

## Design of bioreactor 
> biomass (Silva-Teira et al., 2017, p. 972)

where is this biomass taken from???

> Type I methanotrophs were detected in large quantities in both suspended and Levapor biomass...(which)demonstrates the importance of the AMO-D pathway (Silva-Teira et al., 2017, p. 977)

> DAMO microorganisms were detected, especially as bacteria... moreover, anammox positives have been detected mostly as biofilm (Silva-Teira et al., 2017, p. 977)

> Coexistence of both DAMO and anammox indicated the presence of the anaerobic consortium predicted by [15] and confirmed the elimination of methane and nitrogen through DAMO via (Silva-Teira et al., 2017, p. 977)

## Results of  bioreactor 
> pre-anoxic MBR post-treatment is capable of consistently removing 80% of dissolved methane with peaks up to 95%. Up to 10–15 mgN L 1 of the wastewater was continuously eliminated (Silva-Teira et al., 2017, p. 978)

> Microbiological studies elucidated that AMO-D was present due to the great abundance of the most representative microorganisms. Batch assays and microbiological tests undoubtedly demonstrated the presence of DAMO activity (Silva-Teira et al., 2017, p. 978)
