## Biochemistry of methanotrophic bacteria 

> Methanotrophs are ==methylotrophic bacteria able to utilize CH4 as the sole carbon and energy source==, although several ==yeast== genera such as Sporobolomyces and Rhodotorula or even the green ==microalgae== Chlorella have been reported as methane oxidizers (López et al., 2013, p. 2278)

> ==Most methanotrophs oxidize CH4 in the presence of O2, although some strains can couple the oxidation of CH4 to the reduction of sulfate, nitrate, nitrite, manganese, or iron== (López et al., 2013, p. 2278)

> ==Three types of methanotrophs== are distinguished (López et al., 2013, p. 2278)

> ==All methanotrophs use methane monooxygenases (MMOs) during the aerobic oxidation of CH4 to methanol==, utilizing reducing equivalents for the split of the O2 bonds. (López et al., 2013, p. 2279)

> Two forms of MMOs have been identified in methanotrophs: ==soluble and particulat==e (López et al., 2013, p. 2279)

> soluble MMO form (sMMO) monooxygenase has a broader range of substrates than other monooxygenases and it is composed of a hydroxylase, a reductase, and a regulatory protein (López et al., 2013, p. 2279)

> sMMOs are synthesized when levels of Cu2+ are below 0.86 μmolg−1 dry weight (dw) and contain iron as an important cofactor in the reaction center (López et al., 2013, p. 2279)

> particulate or membrane-bound MMOs (pMMO) are constitutive in all aerobic methanotrophs at Cu2+ concentrations above 0.86 μmolg−1 dw, except in the genera Methyloferula and Methylocella (López et al., 2013, p. 2279)

> pMMO is also composed of three polypeptides, which exhibit a lower specific activity compared to sMMO (López et al., 2013, p. 2279)

> Soluble MMOs employ NADH+H+ as reducing agent to oxidize the CH4 present in the intracellular medium to CH3OH, (López et al., 2013, p. 2279)

> pMMO requires a cytochrome complex to oxidize the CH4 present in the cytoplasm. Then, the periplasmic enzyme methanol dehydrogenase catalyzes the conversion of methanol to formaldehyde (López et al., 2013, p. 2279)

> Formaldehyde is then either converted to formic acid by formaldehyde dehydrogenase or to biomass through the RuMP pathway in type I and X methanotrophs or through the serine pathway in type II methanotrophs (López et al., 2013, p. 2279)

> Finally, carbon dioxide is produced from formate in an oxidation step catalyzed by formate dehydrogenase with the production of the reducing equivalents required at the initial steps of CH4 oxidation (López et al., 2013, p. 2279)

> type X methanotrophs can assimilate formaldehyde through the RuMP pathway while fixing CO2 using a ribulose-1,5bisphosphate carboxylase (López et al., 2013, p. 2279)

> anaerobic methane-oxidizing archaea, which are responsible for 7–25 % of the total CH4 oxidation worldwide, can undertake this process in symbiosis with sulfate-reducing bacteria, using CH4 as an electron donor to convert sulfate into sulfite (López et al., 2013, p. 2279)

> On the other hand, aerobic CH4 oxidizing bacteria can grow concomitantly with denitrifying bacteria, consuming oxygen and producing electron donors for denitrification (López et al., 2013, p. 2279)

> support the hypothesis that sMMOs are usually expressed at high CH4 concentrations and pMMO at low CH4 concentrations (López et al., 2013, p. 2280)

> Methanotrophs are mesophilic microorganisms (López et al., 2013, p. 2280)

may be a good figure to reproduce in the essay!

> ammonia fertilizers seem to be more hazardous to type II than to type I methanotrophs (Mohanty et al. 2006). (López et al., 2013, p. 2281)

relevant for agriculture...

> Microbial CH4 oxidation can be coupled with the production of high added-value biotechnological products. Thus, some methanotrophs can utilize acetyl-CoA from the serine or RuMP pathways to form polyhydroxyalkanoates such as polyhydroxybutyrate (PHB), an important commodity in the bioplastic industry (Higgins et al. 1981; Lidstrom and Stirling 1990). (López et al., 2013, p. 2281)

> Unfortunately, forced air ventilation to provide the O2 needed by aerobic methanotrophs is not recommended when treating real landfill CH4 emissions to avoid explosion risks (CH4 concentration in landfill gas in the range of 30–70 % v/v) (Kallistova et al. 2005; Zamorano et al. 2007). (López et al., 2013, p. 2282)

## Biofilters 
> Despite being relatively simple systems, ==biofilters constitute the most studied and implemented technology to date and can support high CH4 removal rates when parameters such as the O2 concentration or the moisture content are optimized==. For instance, biofilter operation in landfills at O2 concentrations of 18–28 μM (1.7–2.6 % in the gas phase) resulted in maximum oxidation rates of 1.78×10−6mol CH4g−1 dwh−1 (Gebert et al. 2003). (López et al., 2013, p. 2282)

> intensive research conducted on biofiltration over the last 20 years has resulted in important ==advances in packing material technology== (López et al., 2013, p. 2282)

> ==optimum environmental conditions, nutrient requirements, and potential inhibitors of CH4 oxidation in biofilters have been recently identified== (Veillette et al. 2012). (López et al., 2013, p. 2283)

> To the best of our knowledge, Park et al. (2009) reported the highest abatement performance in a biofilter treating CH4 with a maximum EC of 280 gm−3h−1 (corresponding to an RE of 50 %) at an EBRT of 1.2 h. Girard et al. (2011) achieved an EC of 14.5 gm−3h−1 in a biofilter operated at an EBRT of 0.07 h. Interestingly, a similar EC to that obtained by Park et al. (2009) would be expected if the ECs obtained by Girard et al. (2011) were multiplied by 17, which is the EBRT ratio between these reports. (López et al., 2013, p. 2283)

> At this point, it is important to stress that ==little attention has been given to the microbiological aspects in bioreactors devoted to CH4 abatement== (Scheutz et al. 2009). (López et al., 2013, p. 2283)

> In some studies, the bioreactors were operated for months to ==stimulate the growth of the indigenous methanotrophic microorganisms present in the packing materials==, which resulted in either very ==long start-up periods== (du Plessis et al. 2003; Einola et al. 2008) or in a ==poor CH4 abatement performance== (Berger et al. 2005). (López et al., 2013, p. 2283)

> ==More efficient performance and shorter start-up periods were recorded when the bioreactor was inoculated with methanotrophic biomass from the leachate== (or directly with a portion of the packing material) of a CH4-treating biofilter (Nikiema and Heitz 2009; Avalos et al. 2012). The e==nrichment of methanotrophs from activated sludge of wastewater treatment plants== is also another common strategy to ==produce acclimated inocula== and to reduce process start-up periods (Rocha-Rios et al. 2009). (López et al., 2013, p. 2283)

> microbiology and reactor/packing material design are important research areas to be pursued due to their key role on bioreactor start-up and abatement performance (López et al., 2013, p. 2283)

biochemistry – need to focus on the microbiology aspect.

## Limitations 
> Despite the promising potential of biotechnologies for the abatement of CH4,N2O, and CO2 emissions, their ==cost efficient application is often limited by the poor mass transport of CH4==, and in a lower extent of N2O and CO2, ==from the gas to the aqueous phase due to the low aqueous solubility of these GHGs== (dimensionless Henry’s law constants, H, HCH4=30, HN2O=2, and HCO2=1.2). Thus, these high H values ==result in low concentration gradients (low driving forces) for GHG mass transport from the gas to the aqueous phase containing or surrounding the microbial communities and, therefore, in a reduced GHG biodegradation performance== (Muñoz et al. 2007). (López et al., 2013, p. 2294)

> In the particular case of CH4 and N2O, this ==low mass transport entails process operation at high EBRTs, which significantly increases both the investment and operating costs of conventional biotechnologies==. (López et al., 2013, p. 2294)

> ==microbial characteristics and, in particular, microbial affinity for the target pollutant quantified as KM and KS play a key role on the performance of biotechnologies treating poorly soluble gaseous pollutants== (Hernández et al. 2010;Rocha-Rioset al. 2011). (López et al., 2013, p. 2294)

> Despite the empirical evidence for the fact that microorganisms can mineralize pollutants down to the picograms per liter level, the ==number of studies evaluating pollutant biodegradation at the micrograms per liter to nanograms per liter level is unfortunately scarce== (Roch and Alexander 1997). (López et al., 2013, p. 2294)
