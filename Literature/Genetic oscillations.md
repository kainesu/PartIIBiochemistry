Do gene networks that span multiple cell types behave like their single-cell counter parts? 

(I think there is an application to *communities* of different single celled organisms...)

Engineering control systems for asymmetric cell division in synthetic bacteria

- Some bacteria can undergo asymmetric cell division e.g. *Caulobacter crescentus* (Bowman et al 2013, Laloux & Jacobs-Wagner 2013)
- Plasmid aggregation leads to ACD (Molinari et al 2019)

Synthetic cell building should follow the principle of model building – if a simpler cell can do the same thing, then use the simpler cell. 

Applications of synthetic asymmetric division 

- Bioelectronics – electron conducting bacteria surrounded by insulating bacteria (similar to myelinated neuron!)
- Creation of protective biofilms
- Using microbial consortia that divide asymmetrically to model tissues (e.g. neuron, eye?)
