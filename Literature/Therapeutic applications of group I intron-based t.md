# Therapeutic applications

- Delivering wt allele of genes cannot restore function when the mutation is dominant e.g. cancer
- Instead, we can use antisense oligonucleotides (ASOs) or RNAi to reduce expression of such pathogenic genes
- CRISPR/Cas may not be effective when the disease is due to alterations in RNA or alternative splicing or overxpression
- Ribozymes can be classified as a cleaving or splicing type â€” both types have been programmed to recognize and cleave/splice RNA in *trans* (i.e. cleave/splice another RNA molecule)
- Trans-splicing ribozymes edit RNA by eliminating and at the same time repairing the target RNA
- Since trans-splicing ribozymes would not require a protein, it has reduced toxicity and immunogenicity
- Ribozyme specificity could be increased by controlling the binding length of the target or through post-transcriptional regulation
