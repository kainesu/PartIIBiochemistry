- Loop 1 is important for substrate specificity in Tdt, pol μ and pol λ
- SD1 (at C terminal border of Loop1) and SD2 (in β-turn-β structure close to Loop 1) are important for TdT activity.
    - F401A mutation in Tdt confers *in cis* templated polymerase activity
- TdT can add random deoxyribonucleotides (dNTPs) on a ssDNA primer, which has to be at least three nucleotides long, in a template-independent manner
    - TdT can use all 4 natural dNTPs, but it prefers dCTP and dGTP to dATP and dTTP
- Pol μ also has significant nucleotidyltransferase activity in presence of Mn2+
- TdT and Pol μ can incorporate both deoxyribonucleotides and ribonucleotides, but pol λ and pol β only incorporate deoxyribonucleotides
    - The YF sequence motif, the so-called steric-gate at the vicinity of the 2' OH of the nucleotide, prevents the binding of rNTPs in pol l and pol b
    - A GW sequence motif in TdT and pol m increases the size of the nucleotide binding pocket, allowing binding of both dNTPs and rNTPs
    - However, addition of rNTPs by TdT stops after few incorporations on ssDNA
- TdT can also incorporate efficiently various un-natural bases

Why does this diagram suggest that Pol β does not fix DSB DNA? Didn't it do so in the CGBE mechanism? 

- TdT can assemble a DNA synapsis by itself, optimally with a microhomology base-pair between the strands
- TdT can also perform a template-dependent nucleotide incorporation across strands breaks in the presence of an excess of downstream dsDNA with a 3' protruding end
    - This template dependent activity uses an *in trans* template strand (rather than the usual *in cis*)
        - Also described for Pol μ but without the need of an excess of downstream DNA duplex
