- More than 13% of tree species have no protection
- Almost 15% of all species are exposed to high or very high human pressure, 68% to moderate pressure, 17% not under pressure
    - Due to land use for agriculture, timber, fuel gathering, pollution, pollution, invasive species
- The Global 200 is the most effective plan for protecting tree diversity
- We should strategically select land to maximise biodiversity protection by looking at species distributions
