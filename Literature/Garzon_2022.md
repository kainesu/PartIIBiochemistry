-   We should think critically about how our biases about “civilisation”, “intelligence”, and “alien” mean for the search for extraterrestrial life
-   SETI is a mirror onto ourselves. By searching for an “other”, we define what “other” means with respect to ourselves
-   Space is colonised – countries want to conquer it, space infrastructure is located in lands of indigenous people
-   Space imperialism?
-   Why is searching for intelligence important for us?
