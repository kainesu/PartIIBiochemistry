"Global methane concentrations passed 1860 ppb for the first time in 2018, two-and-a-half-times greater than preindustrial levels"

"After CO2, methane (CH4) is the most dominant anthropogenic greenhouse gas. It is 84 times more potent than CO2 over the first 20 years after release and ~28 times more potent after a century."

"Dominated by agricultural and fossil fuel sources, anthropogenic CH4 emissions are currently ~60% of the global total of ~560 Tg yr–1"

Advantage of removing methane vs CO<sub>2</sub> – "In contrast to negative emissions scenarios for CO2 that typically assume hundreds of billions of tonnes removed over decades and do not restore the atmosphere to preindustrial levels, methane concentrations could be restored to ~750 ppb by removing ~3.2 of the 5.3 Gt of CH4 currently in the atmosphere"

Authors suggest that to remove methane, we should oxidise it to CO2 rather than capturing and storing it – "Rather than capturing and storing the methane, the 3.2 Gt of CH4 could be oxidized to CO2, a thermodynamically favourable reaction (CH4 + 2O2 → CO2 + 2H2O; ΔHr = –803 kJ mol–1). The large activation barrier associated with splitting methane’s C–H bond (435 kJ mol–1) could in principle be **overcome by metal or other catalysts**."
This would eliminate "one sixth of total radiative forcing"
Other catalysts -> could be biological! 

Removing methane would result in "reduction in short-term warming, attributable to methane’s high radiative forcing and relatively short lifetime, would also provide more time to adapt to warming from long-lived greenhouse gases such as CO2 and N2O"

However, for several reasons it is more challenging to capture CH4 from the air than CO2 
- CH4 is found in lower concentrations than CO2 in atmosphere, 200-fold lower 
- CH4 has no strong quadrupole moment, not weakly acidic unlike CO2 
- Tetrahedral CH4 molecule makes physical capture difficult and it also "lacks an obvious point of catalytic entry"
- C-H bond in methane is difficult to activate 
- "Traditional liquid solvents lack sufficient CH4 affinity to be of commercial use"
- "Traditional enrichment of even relatively concentrated methane flows requires a large number of cycles and, hence, energy."

To overcome this problem, the authors suggest trapping CH<sub>4</sub> in nanoporous zeolites or porous polymer networks 

Economic problems – "economics of scaled CH4 conversion to CO2 or CH3OH still need to be resolved"
- Need a price on carbon emissions 
- "Methane conversion would likely be more expensive per tonne than negative emissions for CO2, and its potential cost and profitability remain uncertain, but it could yield greater climate and economic value because of methane’s greater potency as a greenhouse gas."
- "Research is also needed for scaling methane removal industrially" 

"in agriculture, some methane emissions from rice and meat production seem inevitable, even after substantial efforts to reduce them"

"economic feasibility (of methane oxidation) will depend on effective mechanisms for trapping and catalytic oxidation."

"methane conversion could also be more attractive for climate benefit than CO2 removal alone because of the much smaller scale (that is, ~3.2 billion tonnes CH4 in total removal) and relative importance (about one sixth of total radiative forcing"
