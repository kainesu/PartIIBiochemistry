## Background on methane emissions from agriculture 
> The main sources of methane (CH4) emissions from agriculture are enteric fermentation, manure management, rice cultivation and residue burning (Smith et al., 2021, p. 2)

> Enteric CH4 is produced under anaerobic conditions by a diverse community of methanogenic archaea (Smith et al., 2021, p. 2)

> The quantity of feed consumed by a ruminant largely determines the quantity of CH4 emitted, though the type and quality of the animal feed also influence emissions (Smith et al., 2021, p. 2)

> species of ruminant, an individual’s digestive physiology and the makeup of the resident microbial population can also influence the quantity of CH4 it produces (Smith et al., 2021, p. 2)

> Methane production from animal wastes is also an anaerobic microbial process and occurs mostly when animal wastes are stored (manure management) (Smith et al., 2021, p. 2)

> Methane emissions from paddy rice occur when soils are flooded, which creates anaerobic conditions suitable for methanogenic microorganisms to produce CH4 (Smith et al., 2021, p. 2)

> Of total anthropogenic CH4 emissions, the majority were attributable to the agriculture and waste sector, with bottom-up and top-down estimates of 213 (198–232) and 227 (205246) Tg y−1, respectively, in 2017 (Smith et al., 2021, p. 2)

Justification for methane removal interventions in agriculture and waste sector

## Biological methods of reducing enteric emissions 

> For improved feeding practices, CH4 emissions can be reduced by feeding livestock more concentrates which normally replace forage (Smith et al., 2021, p. 5)

Biochemistry used to create the feed?

> net benefit, however, depends on reduced animal numbers or younger age at slaughter for beef animals and on how the practice affects emissions when producing and transporting the concentrates (Smith et al., 2021, p. 6)

> adding oils to the diet (Smith et al., 2021, p. 6)

which oils? biochemical question?

> A wide range of specific agents and dietary additives have been tested, mostly aimed at suppressing methanogenesis. These include ionophores, which are antibiotics that can reduce CH4 emissions [46–48], but their effect may be **transitory** [49] and they have been **banned in some jurisdictions**, such as the European Union. (Smith et al., 2021, p. 6)

"transitory" so not very long term...
some biochemical methods may also face legality issues – would be good to look into why? Are they harmful? 

> Halogenated compounds which inhibit methanogenic bacteria [50,51] have also been tested, but their effects, too, are often **transitory** and they can have side effects such as reduced calorie intake. (Smith et al., 2021, p. 6)

> Probiotics, such as yeast culture, have shown only small, insignificant effects [48], but selecting strains specifically for CH4 reducing ability could improve results [52]. (Smith et al., 2021, p. 6)

> Propionate precursors, such as fumarate or malate, reduce CH4 formation by acting as alternative hydrogen acceptors [53], but are effective only at high doses and are, therefore, expensive [54] (Smith et al., 2021, p. 6)

not economically feasible...

> Vaccines against methanogenic bacteria have been developed but are not yet commercially available [55]. (Smith et al., 2021, p. 6)

potential for future development?

> Bovine somatotrophin (bST) and hormonal growth implants do not specifically suppress CH4 formation, but by improving animal performance [56,57] they can reduce the emission intensity (emissions per unit of product) of meat/dairy [58,59], but like ionophores, are banned in some jurisdictions, such as the European Union (Smith et al., 2021, p. 6)

> Some natural feed additives, such as seaweed, have been tried [60]. (Smith et al., 2021, p. 6)

And what was the efficacy? 

> A shift toward meat from monogastrics (e.g. pig and poultry) also lowers CH4 emissions, since they produce no enteric CH4, although emissions from manure management remain. In a metaanalysis, Aleksandrowicz et al.[93] showed that a vegan diet reduced emissions by 45% (greater than 20% to greater than 70%) relative to current average diets, vegetarian diet reduced emissions by approximately 30% (15% to approx. 60%) while the transition to meat from monogastrics reduced emissions by approximately 20% (Smith et al., 2021, p. 8)

Indirect, but biochemistry could help to push changes in diet through the development of alternative meats -> reduce demand for monogastric meat and meat in general

> Priority regions for reducing CH4 emissions from enteric fermentation and manure management are China, India, Brazil, EU, US, Australia, Russia and Latin America (Brazil, Argentina, Mexico, Colombia, Paraguay, Bolivia). Priority regions for reducing CH4 emissions by improving water and residue management of rice fields, and manure management are in Asia, namely India, China, Indonesia, Thailand, Bangladesh, Vietnam, Philippines (Smith et al., 2021, p. 9)

Worthy to note that many of these countries are developing nations which may not have as much income at their disposal to use expensive methods of methane removal, so cheaper methods are favourable
