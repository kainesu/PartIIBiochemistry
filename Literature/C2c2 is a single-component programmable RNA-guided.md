- C2c2 contains two HEPN domains that are likely responsible for its catalytic activity
- C2c2 can be retargeted by changing the crRNA
- LshC2c2 is specific to ssRNA
- LshC2c2 prefers C, A, and U PFSs
- LshC2c2 observed to have the same cleavage pattern regardless of the crRNA position along the target RNA
    - Cleavage pattern is dependent on features of the target sequence rather than distance from the binding site
    - Cleavage may occur at exposed regions of ssRNA within secondary structure elements
        - Test using target RNA with different sequences flanking an identical 28nt protospacer
- Prefers to cleave at uracil-rich regions of ssRNA or ssRNA-dsRNA junctions within in silico-predicted ***cofolds*** of the target sequence *with* the crRNA
    - Tested using homopolymeric RNA targets (a 28nt protospacer with 120 As or Us regularly interspaced by single bases of G or C to enable oligo synthesis) — LshC2c2 preferred uracil targets to adenine
    - Tested cleavage of a modified ssRNA that had main site of cleavage, a loop, replaced with four possible homopolymers – cleavage only occurred at the uracil homopolymer loop
- Stem-loop structure of crRNA is important for ssRNA cleavage to occur
    - A direct repeat longer than 24nt is required to maintain the stem loop
- Inverting all four GC pairs in the stem eliminated cleavage despite maintaining the same structure
- Introducing kinks, reduceed base pairing in the stem also eliminated or drastically reduced cleavage ⇒ crRNA stem length is important for formation and activity
- Loop deletions eliminate cleavage while insertions, substitutions maintained some level of cleavage activity
- Nearly all substitutions or deletions in the region 3' to the DR prevented cleavage by LshC2c2
- C2c2 is capable of non-specific cleavage of cellular mRNAs
    - C2c2 cleaves target RNA outside of crRNA binding site at varying distances depending on flanking sequence, presumably within exposed ssRNA loop regions
