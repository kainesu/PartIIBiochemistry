## Methane emissions from rice paddies 
> ==Rice paddies are a significant source of CH4,== which is problematic as ==rice production alone is anticipated to increase== from 600 million tonnes in 2000 to 930 million tonnes by 2030 (Kubo and Purevdorj, 2004). (Singh and Strong, 2016, p. 268)

## What are biofertilisers 
> organic fertilizers are combined with microbial amendments (biofertilizers) is a promising alternative to inorganic fertilizers. (Singh and Strong, 2016, p. 268)

> Biofertilizers are organic fertilizers amended with organisms capable of beneficial functions such as photosynthesis or N2-fixation. (Singh and Strong, 2016, p. 270)

## Biofertilisers with aerobic photosynthetic organisms improves soil oxygenation, which enhances methane oxidation 
> Applying biofertilizers that contain aerobic photosynthetic organisms, such as cyanobacteria or Azolla, has improved and sustained oxygenation of flooded paddy soils (Singh and Strong, 2016, p. 270)

improving oxygenation of soils improves methane oxidation as methanotrophs are aerobic

> Applying diazotrophs (Ochrobactrum anthropi, Azotobacter and Azospirillum) have also lowered methane emissions from paddy fields (Pingak et al., 2014). (Singh and Strong, 2016, p. 270)

> Methane emitted from paddy field soils that had been treated with urea, urea þ a cyanobacterial mixture, Azolla,orAzolla þ a cyanobacterial mixture (modified from Prasanna et al. (2002)). (Singh and Strong, 2016, p. 273)

> Methane uptake efficiency of different cyanobacteria inoculated paddy soils (modified from Prasanna et al. (2002)). (Singh and Strong, 2016, p. 273)

## Lowering methane emissions by stimulating root growth 
> Inoculating Azospirillum to rice plant roots may lower CH4 emissions by stimulating extensive root growth and consequently increasing O2 exchange and CH4 oxidation in the rhizosphere. (Singh and Strong, 2016, p. 270)

## Increasing N availability 
> Nitrogen-fixing bacteria increase N availability to paddy crops (Cassman et al., 1998). Rhizobia (Rosch et al., 2002), methanotrophs (Knief et al., 2003; Hackl et al., 2004) and Archaea ( (Singh and Strong, 2016, p. 270)

## Some microbe species both promote plant growth and take up methane 
> Plant growth promoting strains of Paenibacillus illinoisensis, Bacillus aerius, B. subtilis and Rhizobium sp. contained the pmoA gene (encodes a subunit pMMO), while strains of Bacillus megaterium, P. illinoisensis, Methylobacterium extrorquens and Rhizobium sp. contained the mmoX gene (encodes a subunit of the hydroxylase of sMMO). Nitrosomonas spp. are nitrifying bacteria that obtain electrons for energy from oxidizing ammonia to nitrite. Although they fix carbon dioxide, their ammonia oxidase enzyme is not specific and can also oxidize CH4 - albeit at oxidation rates less than 5% of pure methanotroph cultures (Singh and Strong, 2016, p. 272)

## Non-biological amendments to fertilisers that facilitate methanotroph growth in soils 
> Besides beneficial microbes, other amendments to organic fertilizers may facilitate the growth of methane oxidizing bacteria. (Singh and Strong, 2016, p. 272)

### Promoting methane oxidation in saline soils
> ==Saline conditions in paddy soils can lower the activity and size of methane-oxidizing communities== (Singh and Strong, 2016, p. 272)

> ==Organic amendments== are traditional practices for reclaiming such soils (Supparattanapan et al., 2009), while ==pyrite== is recommended for reclaiming saline, sodic or usar land soils, (Singh and Strong, 2016, p. 272)

> Field studies have confirmed that ==farmyard manure in conjunction with pyrite== can increase the number of methanotrophs in salinity-affected paddy fields (Singh et al., 2010) (Singh and Strong, 2016, p. 272)

> short-term field experiments indicate scope for using ==fly ash in combination with organic manure (press mud)== to increase methanotroph numbers in dry-tropical nutrient-poor saline soils (Singh and Strong, 2016, p. 272)

> An alternative strategy to improve methane oxidation in saline soils could include ==seeding with salttolerant methanotrophs==. Halophilic methanotrophs belonging to the genus Methylmicrobium are known (Singh and Strong, 2016, p. 272)

## Areas for future research 
> ==Cyanobacteria, Azolla, and fungal mycorrhizae serve as model organisms== for biofertilizer systems. (Singh and Strong, 2016, p. 273)

> direct and indirect effects with regard to the soil CH4 sink potential is yet to be fully elucidated, optimized and beneficially exploited. (Singh and Strong, 2016, p. 273)

> Fig. 1. A conceptual model illustrating improved methanotrophic diversity and CH4 sink potential with the use of bio-fertilizers (Singh and Strong, 2016, p. 273)
