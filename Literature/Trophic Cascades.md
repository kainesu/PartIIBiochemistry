# Chapter 1

- Predators regulate food web in top-down manner
- Top vertebrate predators are large-bodied → mobile → link distinct communities, ecosystems → respond to shifts in prey abundance
- Loss of apex predators results in a **trophic cascade** that results in an altered state with less biodiversity
- It is difficult to measure the response of ecosystems to predator removal as responses can have long time lags, during which other factors may intervene
- Strength of top-down interaction depends on predator, prey, and context of interaction (e.g. environment)
- Bottom-up processes determine the flow of resources into the system, while top-down processes influence how resources are distributed among trophic levels
- Keystone species have large effects on other ecosystem elements relative to its biomass
- Green world hypothesis
- Criticism of manipulative experiments: too short time scale, do not truly remove all natural enemies of herbivores
- Top vertebrate predators tend to have low population densities, large home ranges → vulnerable to habitat fragmentation
- Low intrinsic growth rate → sensitive to increased mortality
- Top predators have opportunistic diets and are spatially mobile → often come into direct contact with humans, livestock → conflict with humans
- Food chain length should increase with productivity of basal trophic level
    - However, some unproductive ecosystems have top predators due to other factors e.g. mobility, long generation lengths, adaptations to cope with resource scarcity
- Resilience of food chain to perturbations decreases with increasing chain length (more "delicate")
- Density dependence in predators buffers them from changes in food supply, which can help stabilize the entire ecosystem
    - Instability = large oscillations in plant-herbivore populations→ possible extinction during population troughs
- "Chaotic dynamics can arise when eachtrophic link has a saturating response, so that each consumer–resource interactionon its own tends toward unstable limit cycle behavior"
- In reality, unstable dynamics are rare
    - Spatial heterogeneity
    - Mobility
    - Refugia are present in landscaps for predator, prey, producer
    - Spatial mobility and behavioral flexibility of top predators buffer unstable dynamics of food chains
- Loss of large food-limited herbivores has altered much of earth's terrestrial vegetation
- Diversity at prey trohic level can moderate top-down control
- Diversity at predator level may increase or weaken top-down effects
    - Increase → niche complementarity (e.g. different predators feeding at diff times of day)
    - Decrease → Intraguild predation, interference between predator speices is strong (e.g. in biological control of agricultural pests; vertebrate carnivore guilds)
- Alternative equilibra are possible for ecosystems; as such the **initial conditions** (i.e. sequence of colonization events in the past) affects the current state of the community
- Regime shifts and hysteresis (Regime shift occurs at a different point depending on the direction of change)
- State changes may be reversed

# Chapter 2

- Trophic spectrum – food choice is varied. Omnivores blur trophic levels
- Keystone species are polyphyletic – behavior & ecology govern relationship
- A keystone becomes recognized due to keystone prey's potential to outcompete other resource-limited neighbours
- In many intertidal communities, sessile animals dominate the limiting resource – space – but have little influence on productivity of their prey (i.e. plankton)
- Ecosystem resilience – rate and trajectory at which system shifts beween alternative states

# Chapter 3: Effects of Apex Predators

- Sea otters and kelp forests – kelp creates 3D habitats, reduces wave height and velocity, increases production
- Otters thwarted an evolutionary arms race between kelps and their herbivores – Australasian kelps have higher levels of phlorotannin (a chemical defense) than in northeast Pacific species ( where sea otters are present)
    - Compare with NZ – fish, lobsters act as top predator; but they are less effective predators → plants have higher herbivore resistance
- Loss of apex predators → increase in mesopredators
- Loss of top-down could lead to predator-prey role reversal (e.g. lobster reintroduction to Marcus Island)

# Chapter 7: Role of herbivores in terrestrial trophic cascades

- Herbivores affect the strength of cascades (i.e. degree of plant response) and scale (from single plants to entire communities)
- The strength of a cascade can be no greater than the effect of herbivores on plants
- Herbivores impact ecosystems through consumption of plants and by manipulating the physical environment
    - Changing physical environment → changes resource availability for other organisms
    - Deposition of fecal matter → nutrient cycling
- Herbivores affect plant succession depending on their preference for earlier or later successional species
    - Vertebrates → late successional species (tree seedling establishment)
    - Insect herbivores → early successional species
- Vegetation boundaries
- Plant evolution
- Vertebrate herbivores have greater impacts at the level of the plant community while invertebrates have greater impacts on individual plants and single plant species
    - Vertebrates – large, mobile, broad diets
    - Invertebrates – small, less mobile, specialized diets
- Top down control of herbivores is less effective if
    - Herbivore is large and gregarious – decreases predator success
    - Defenses
    - If herbivores arrive early in succession, they escape trophic control temporarily as they arrive before predators are present
    - Climate

# Chapter 10: Islands as tests of the Green World Hypothesis

- GWH: Predators prevent herbivores from depleting terrestrial vegetation
- Test GWH by maintaining habitats without predators – e.g., on islands
- Predators are prone to random extinctions due to low population densities
- E.g. extinction of crocodiles from Aldabra → tortoise population boom → herbivory → shift from woody to herbaceous vegetation
- Multiple case studies of cervids (e.g. Sctoland, Japan subalpine forests) show that herbivores can change vegetation landscape in the absence of predator regulation
    - Consequently the cervids can survive on low-quality forage at the cost of reduced body size and reproductive output

# Chapter 13: Ecological and Conservation Implications of Mesopredator Release

- Predators regulate other predators
- Mesopredator release
    - Definition issues – arbitrary body size definition is not linked to ecological principles; it also emphasizes impact of mesopredatory on prey (rather than interaction between apex and meso predator)
    - A subset of ecological release? – absence or negative change in density or distribution of an apex predator → expansion in density, distribution, behavior of a mesopredator irrespective of body size.
- Apex predators, mesoopredators in studies are often exotic or undesirable species
    - The control of nuisances can result in release of even worse nuisances (i.e. mesoprdeators)
- Two factors should strongly influence mesopredator release:the productivity of the system and the strength of interactions betweenapex predators, mesopredators, and prey
- We predict domination by mesopredators in low productivitysystems, domination by apex predators in high-productivity systems, and the greatest chances for coexistence in systems of intermediate productivity
    - Top-down effects are strongest in the most productive regions
    - Mesopredators are regulated by limited abundance of prey rather than by predation in less productive areas
    - In more productive areas, mesopredators can increase in abundance when apex predators are removed
- High species diversity, wide diet niche breadths weaken strength of mesopredator release
    - E.g. If a system already has many apex predators, removal of one apex predator will not have a big effect on mesopredator populations
    - Or, if the apex predators consume a variety of prey, the impact of the predator removal on one particular prey species should not be that large
- Apex predators tend to have more restricted and carnivorous diet than mesopredators
    - Mesopredators are positioned lower in food web, have wider resource base → suppress wider range of species when released
- If the ecosystem overall has more bottom-up control, then removal of apex predator may not have much impact

# Chapter 14: Fear-mediated food webs

- How does the threat of predation govern prey behaviour?
- Herbivores interact with scavengers – use scavengers as indicators of predator presence
- Many fear responses are learned (e.g. moose in Alaska responding to ravens, wolves)
- Fear response 1 – prey aggregation (forming groups) → patchiness of grazing regime
- Fear response 2 – movements and refuge use
    - Moose mothers shift locations of living, birth when offspring have died to carnivores ⇒ affects herbivore density, food webs
- Fear response 3 - behavioural changes
- Lesser carnivores may attempt to reduce encounters with larger carnivores bytemporal or spatial partitioning of activities.

# Chapter 18: Theoretical perspectives on trophic cascades

- Different trophic linkages may actually be interdependent
- E.g. rate of consumption of a plant may depend on traits of the herbivore that *also* influence its risk of predation
    - Foraging activity exposes a herbivore to predation, and at the same time increases herbivory
- E.g. aphids release pheromones that cause wingless adults to lay winged offspring → offspring have lower fecundity but can disperse to escape predation; aphid density on original host plant falls, weakening the aphid impact in the local ecosystem
- E.g. When wildebeest population declined, herbivory fell, which led to taller grasses, allowing lions to hide better from prey, intensifying predation on wildebeest → further vegetation growth etc (creates positive feedback loop)

# Chapter 19: Comparing trophic cascades across ecosystems

- Effect size of predator removal on plant community biomass may be stronger in aquatic than terrestrial ecosystems
    - Weaker grazing control of autotroph biomass in terrestrial systems?
- Invertebrate herbivores tend to exert stronger control over plant biomass than vertebrates

**Factors that differentiate ecosystems and their effects on cascade strength**

- Diversity: Marine ecosystems have more diverse plankton, fish communities
    - Diversity among species that share similar resources weaken top down effects
        - Assuming degree of generality does not increase with diversity, then adding more species should "spread out" the top down control
- Omnivory: Omnivory blurs trophic levels.
    - Food chain length is longest in marine systems than lakes or terrestrial systems
    - Omnivorous copepods act as predators of protozoans in oligotrophic (low nutrient) conditions, but are herbivorous in more productive areas
        - So in more productive areas, food chains shorten as omnivores act as herbivores
- On terrestrial systems, predators can affect pollinator populations which directly affect plant populations. In marine systems, phytoplankton reproduction is primarily asexual
- Allometry: planktonic systems are size structured – large consumers prey on species smaller than them; while macroscopic plants are consumed by herbivores of different size ranges from larger to smaller
    - Large herbivore to producer size ratio should result in strong top-down control bc large herbivores have lower mass-specific metabolic rates ⇒ maintain greater biomass on fewer resources
    - Also, largest terrestrial herbivores have highest metabolic rates and are least efficient consumers
- Stoichiometry: freshwater phytoplankton have lower carbon:nitrogen and carbon:phosphorus ratios than terrestrial plants
    - However, invertebrate herbivores in both systems have high demand for N and P
    - Terrestrial consumers thus face greater elemental mismatches in their food
    

**Outstanding questions**

- Does ****distribution of interaction strength among species vary between ecosystmes
- Does degree of generality and specificty of consumers vary between ecosystems
    - Omnivory
    - Diet breadth
- Plant defenses in differetn ecosystems
- Trophic ontogeny
    - In pelagic systems, most apex predators pass through several trophic levels during development from larva to adult
