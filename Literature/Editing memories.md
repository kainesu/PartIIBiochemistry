Implicit non declarative conditioning - emotional

Particularly strong

Greenberg 2004

Reconsolidation view -> unstable memory system

Hyperthymesia

Nader 2000

Protein synthesis inhibitor -> prevents memory consolidation from active to inactive state

Optogenetics -> crispr memory proteins with a regulatory region. That can be controlled by light (replacement of original protein)

PTSD fear Pavlovian conditioning

Pavlovian extinction

Create a new and competing non fear memory

But - Spontaneous recovery, renewal, reinstatement

Block consolidation or reconsolidation (flux processes between active and inactive state)

Amnestic agents more translatable to humans?

Tronson & Taylor 2007

Target other proteins in memory signaling pathways

B-adrenergic receptor

Propranolol

Debiec & LeDoux (2004)

Mice with propanolol had significantly less fear response than placebo group

Brunet et al 2007

Propanolol also found to have effect on humans in pilot studies

Kindt et al 2009

Separation of explicit and emotional memory (!!)

But propanolol is too general? Would it depress emotional memory of other events? E.g. memory of good events

Exintctioj in reconsolidation window

Monfils 2009

Schiller 2010

James et al 2015

You can’t do two visuospatial memories at the same time

Updating memories with noise with visuospatial interference

Everitt, Dickinson, robbins 2001

Drug addiction is Pavlovian

Knockdown of plasticity-related immediate early genes can disrupt cue drug memory reconsolidation

Alberini & Chen (2012), Lee et al (2005) -> more targeted

NMDAR antagonism disrupts memory reconsolidation

Ketamine

Extinction within reconsolidation window for drug memories

Sleep and reconsolidation → not really well explored but we do know it does do something

Does the way in which PTSD affect treatment
