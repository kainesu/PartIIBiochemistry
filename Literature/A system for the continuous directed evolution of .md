- M13 filamentous bacteriophage requires protein III (pIII) to reproduce (it mediates F pilus binding and host cell entry)
- Phage reproduction is linked to the activity of interest by deleting pIII from the phage vector and inserting pIII into an accessory plasm[[Barstow_2023]]id in host *E. coli*
- For pIII to be produced, the phage needs to have the gene with the desired activity
- Only phage vectors that can induce sufficient pIII production from the accessory plasmid will propagate
- PACE can **evolve any gene that can be linked to pIII production in *E. coli***
- PACE applies optimal evolutionary pressure when pIII levels are above the minimal threshold required to prevent phage washout, but below the amount needed to maximize infectious phage production.
    - This window can be shifted by varying the copy number of the accessory plasmid, or by altering the ribosome-binding site (RBS) sequence of gene III to modulate the efficiency with which gene III is expressed
