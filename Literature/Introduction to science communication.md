learn the principles of good scientific communication

work from principles, not examples

# Principles

## Be objectively readable

- Have other people read what you've done — but this is subjective
- Use readability formulas — Gunning-Fog Index
- Anticipate what the reader needs and meet those needs in your writing
    - Sentences should connect to each other logically
- Microsoft Word has Readability Statistics

## Avoid the style virus

- Stop using nominalizations, passive voice, multi-syllabic, latin/greek origin words (vs saxon origin words)
- Sentences tend to be long due to sharing of detail
- Only include details that readers need — understand the need of readers
- Reduce number of clauses and nested clauses in sentences (try to keep it to at most 2 clauses)
- Remove repetitions or synonyms
- Remove double negatives
- Don't bury the main clause (the lead). Place main clauses at the start or end of the sentence.
- Prioritize CLARITY over consciseness
- Keep headings and text consistent
- A scientific paper should be readable from any point
- Avoid colloquialisms, long modified words, unintelligible acronyms, foreign words
    - long modified word: e.g. maximized survey-derived daily intake
        - Although this is very conscise, it's not clear.
        - Break apart long modified words using prepositions
- Minimize jargon where possible
- Tailor your writing to the average length of articles in the journal or shorter
- Different parts of the paper is meant for different audiences, so different voices may be needed
    - Introduction, conclusion - for new people. Use active voice
    - Methodology - for people who are actually interested in the research. Use passive voice because you need to focus on the method

## Check your sources

- Be careful of predatory journals
- Look at journals that have been around for many years, article is highly cited, journal is on a whitelist (DOAJ.org)
- Avoid journals that are less than 3 years old (too young to have an impact factor), author is controversial, journal/publisher in on blacklist (beallslist.net)

## Don't steal

- Patchwork plagiarism
- Must add citation at the end of each sentence even if each sentence is taken from the same source
- Retaining same sequence of ideas is still plagiarism — when you paraphrase, you should separate yourself from the text. Read, understand, then rewrite it without looking
- Do you retain the copyright? Publishing to OA allows you to keep the copyright, but not if you publish to a subscription access
    - But you need permission of co-authors as you share the copyright
- Do not cite the original assuming that the secondary source is correct — read the original document to make sure the fact is in there
- If several versions (print, electronic) exist, only cite the versions seen as there are often differences between versions
    - Online publications may have retractions, updates, corrections, etc.
