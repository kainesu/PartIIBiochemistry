- Tdt promotes close physical association between the two DNA ends of a DNA synapsis (both with a 3' protruding end)
    - Tdt uses Loop1 and N-terminal domain as a mold
- Upon binding to DNA synapsis, below the nascent base pair, R454 and R458 become more ordered and change rotamers compared to previously known Tdt structures, which blocks one side of the nascent base pair
    - R454 and R458 are important for catalysis
- Together with L398 and F405, R454 and R458 isolate the two base pairs (microhomology and nascent) from the rest of the substrate
- The bases in the nascent pair are recognized in the minor groove by hydrogen bonding to certain residues in SD1 and SD2 domains (Substrate Specificity Sequence Determinant)
    - N474 (SD2) - forms a H bond to D399 (SD1), which H bonds to W450 and salt bridge with K403 (SD1)
    - R461 (Helix N)
    - G449 carbonyl atom
