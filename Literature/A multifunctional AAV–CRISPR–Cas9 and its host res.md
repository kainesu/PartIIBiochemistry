# Background

- Deliver CRISPR-Cas9 with AAVs for genomic therapeutics
    - AAVs are prevalent, serologically compatible with most people, and nonpathogenic
    - AAVs allow for semiselective tissue tropism via local or systemic delivery

**Problems**

- Large Cas9 transgenes take up a lot of space in the AAV, so there is little space left for other gene elements
- Host cell might have an undesirable immune reaction against the AAV-CRISPR-Cas0

# Questions

- What proteins are suitable for splitting? How to design split proteins?
