## Advantage of biological methods over chemical 

> As ==more than 55% of anthropogenic CH4 emissions possess a concentration below the lower explosive limit of CH4 in air mixtures of 5% v/v==, they are incompatible for energy recovery or for chemical oxidation processes for the removal of CH4 (Avalos Ramirez et al., 2012a). In this regard, biotechnologies through the activity of methanotrophs are considered a ==cost-efficient== and ==environmentally-friendly== treatment alternative to physical-chemical technologies. (La et al., 2018, p. 760)

## Places where biofilters have been studied for usse 

> The mitigation of CH4 by biological filtration has been studied extensively in environments experiencing CH4 emissions including peatlands, rice paddy soils, landfill cover soils (Gebert and Gröngröft, 2006; Mei et al., 2015; Scheutz et al., 2017; Wong et al., 2017; Yang et al., 2017), animal houses and manure storage ponds (Melse and van der Werf, 2005; Syed et al., 2017), and wastewater treatment plants (Brandt et al., 2016; Gómez-Borraz et al., 2017). (La et al., 2018, p. 760)

## Possible downstream products of methane 

> Some researchers have proposed using methanotrophs for the partial biological conversion of CH4 emitted from anthropogenic sources into CH3OH under ambient temperatures and pressures (La et al., 2018, p. 761)

> Other potential biotechnological strategies using methanotrophs include the formation of polyhydroxybutyrate (PHB) for the production of biodegradable plastics (Chidambarampadmavathy et al., 2017; Pieja et al., 2011); or production of speciality chemicals and fuels such as biodiesel, butanol, lactate, cosmetics, terpenoids, carotenoids and other chemicals and proteins (Ge et al., 2014; Kalyuzhnaya et al., 2015) (La et al., 2018, p. 761)

Seems that one question that has to be resolved for long term use of biological methane fixation is, what is the downstream product of methane and how will it be used?  
  
If methane captured can be converted into valorised products, there would be increased economic feasibility

> carbon in CH4 can be utilized for energy and result in the production of CO2, biomass, intracellular compounds, or exopolymeric substances. (La et al., 2018, p. 762)

possible downstream products of methane

> A large economic and carbon offset potential, by displacing fossil fuel-derived hydrocarbons, might be found in harvesting the biomass for the development of bio-carbon products (e.g. biofuel, bioplastics) from the extraction of organic inclusion bodies such as poly(3-hydroxybutyrate) (La et al., 2018, p. 770)

need biochemistry to  
  
- understand cellular pathways for converting biomass to valorised products  
- develop techniques to produce and extract products

## Effects of packing medium 

> Kim et al. (2014b) observed that the tobermolite packing medium seemed to repress the abundance of methanotrophs over time which may have resulted in lower efficiencies (La et al., 2018, p. 761)

choice of packing material can affect long term efficiency of biofilters

> In another study by Kim et al. (2014a), nonmethanotrophic bacteria present at the beginning of the experiment were increasingly replaced with methanotrophic bacteria in a perlite-based biofilter. (La et al., 2018, p. 761)

## Use of mixed cultures of microbes is important 
> in a recent study on a field biofilter that had been exposed to H2S over a period of 5-years, Syed et al. (2016b) observed that the methanotrophic community had shifted to Methylocapsa, an acid loving methanoptroph, and elimination capacities of 727 g CH4/m3·d were achieved even as the pH had dropped to 3.72. (La et al., 2018, p. 761)

==Use of mixed cultures of microbes important to long term efficiency==

> In many CH4-emitting environments, such as landfills, CH4 is not the sole volatile organic compound and the ability of type II and some type X to cometabolize other carbon compounds has interesting implications. ==Co-emission of CH4 with other volatiles, that are likely present in the field, may either have an inhibitive effect or promote CH4 oxidation==. For instance, ==Kim et al. (2013) observed a boost to both microbial diversity and CH4 oxidation upon the co-emission of CH4 and dimethylsulfide while co-emission of CH4 with a mixture of dimethylsulfide, butane, and toluene had a detrimental effect to CH4== (La et al., 2018, p. 761)

> diverse bacterial population has a greater ability to tolerate the dynamic environmental variations and stresses that are not normally present in a laboratory setting (La et al., 2018, p. 761)

Adaptability -> long-term efficiency  
  
Cf physical, chemical systems that cannot adapt to the environment

## Using fungi in biofilters? 
> More recently, Lebrero et al. (2016) were successful in operating a fungal-bacterial biofilter for the abatement of CH4 and achieved elimination capacities of 878 g/m3d, at an inlet load of 984 g/m3d, under an EBRT of only 20 min (La et al., 2018, p. 761)

How does this compare with bacterial communities

## Biofilters and enzyme kinetics 

> CH4 concentration greater than 37 μM would ensure that CH4 biofiltration proceeds under zero-order kinetics (La et al., 2018, p. 765)

Biochemical understanding of enzyme kinetics can contribute to our understanding of the kinetics of methane oxidation by microbes  
  
- provide a framework to evaluate efficiency

## Biomass accumulation can become a problem over time 
> Methanotrophic bacteria will produce and accumulate biomass during the operation of a biofilter as a result of the growth of the biofilm (La et al., 2018, p. 765)

> excess amount of biomass in the biofilters will inevitably lead to instability and an associated reduction in the performance of removing the target pollutant (La et al., 2018, p. 765)

could be a long term maintenance problem, though researchers are working on solutions to prevent biomass buildup

## Effect of pH on enzyme activity 
> Deviations of pH from the enzyme’s optima (e.g. MMO) can slow down the rate of CH4 transformation and large pH deviations may permanently damage it as result of denaturation. (La et al., 2018, p. 767)

## Effect of nitrogen compounds and ammonia on methane oxidation rates 
> Hernandez et al. (2015) attributed the inhibition of NH4-N to a combination of (i) competition of NH3 for the active site of MMO, (ii) accumulation of acidic metabolites as a result of nitrification reactions, and (iii) an increase in salinity which induces ionic and osmotic effects (La et al., 2018, p. 767)

Sites with high ammonia concentrations can affect methane oxidation efficiency

## Effect of temperature on enzyme activity and implications for biofilter performance in the field 
> temperature deviations from the enzymes' optima can slow down the rate of CH4 transformation with extreme deviations causing denaturation or crystallization. Diurnal temperature fluctuations has been observed to drop CH4 oxidation rates by more than half the maximum value (La et al., 2018, p. 767)

> seasonal variations in temperature can significantly impact field biofilter and biocover performance (La et al., 2018, p. 767)

Could be problematic for temperate countries.  
  
But then again, wouldn't chemical catalysts be affected by temperature too? Maybe less sensitive.

> field biofilters offer a more controlled environment since they can be capped and insulated to minimize the effects of external variability (La et al., 2018, p. 768)

So insulation could be a solution.  
  
⇒ Key to long-term efficiency is to control the environment of the biofilter for optimal enzymatic activity

> As the oxidation of CH4 is an exothermic process (ΔHc = −802.6 kJ/mol at 298.15 K (Green and Perry, 2007)), the internal temperature of a biofilter tends to rise during operation (La et al., 2018, p. 768)

## Effect of nutrient availability 
> Methanotrophic growth in nature is strongly controlled by the availability of nutrients, particularly nitrogen (Bodelier and Laanbroek, 2004) and phosphorous (Veraart et al., 2015). (La et al., 2018, p. 768)

Wonder if it is possible to use "synthetic ecology" to create a microbial ecosystem within the biofilter that is self-sustaining.  
  
I think this is straying out of biochemistry though lol

## N<sub>2</sub>O production is a long-term risk of biofilter usage 
> Numerous CH4 biofiltration studies have used biologically-stable packing media and the supply of an external nutrient source (e.g. NMS medium). However, most of these studies have not considered the ==potential for N2O production, as a result of denitrification reactions==. (La et al., 2018, p. 769)

## Future (biochemistry?) research 
Biochemistry could contribute in the following ways in the future: 

> Understanding the adaptive behavior of methanotrophs is critical for optimizing the performance and sustainable operation of CH4 biofiltration (La et al., 2018, p. 769)

biochemistry relevance!

> More research in field applications will provide further insight on the ability of the methanotrophs to tolerate dynamic environmental stresses that are not typically encountered in the laboratory. (La et al., 2018, p. 770)

Need to study biochemically! (This whole paragraph is pretty relevant... I'm not going to highlight the whole thing but yea)

> different methanotrophic bacteria have different physiological potentials, so understanding how the microbiological communities shift in response to operational parameters might lead to a deeper understanding of how these parameters affect system performance, and help to develop strategies to maximize activity (La et al., 2018, p. 770)

More biochem research... 

> Monitoring of microbial communities might even become a simple and efficient way to rapidly assess long-term biofilter stability and performance (La et al., 2018, p. 770)

...biochemical methods needed!
