> rice producers could minimize emissions with better irrigation and soil-management practices (Nature, 2021, p. 461)

if this is the case for crops, then how feasible would it be economically for biochemical solutions.

> Research shows that a relatively small number of ‘super-emitters’ are responsible for a significant share of methane emissions, particularly in the oil and gas industry (Nature, 2021, p. 461)

> The climate panel also highlights the problem — and opportunity — posed by methane, which has contributed as much as 0.5°C of warming since preindustrial times, second only to CO2. (Nature, 2021, p. 461)

> Methane is the main component of natural gas, whose popularity as a relatively clean source of fossil energy has soared by more than 50% over the past two decades (Nature, 2021, p. 461)

soared by more than 50% globally or only in the US?  
  
removing methane emissions at point (i.e. at natural gas power plants)

> fossil fuels have helped to boost atmospheric methane concentrations,which have more than doubled since pre-industrial times, from around 700 parts per billion by volume to nearly 1,900 p.p.b. in 2020 (Nature, 2021, p. 461)

> in the first 20 years after release, methane is around 80 times more powerful than CO2 at trapping heat in Earth’s atmosphere. (Nature, 2021, p. 461)

> breaks down much more quickly than CO2 (Nature, 2021, p. 461)

> curbing methane emissions could provide short-term relief (Nature, 2021, p. 461)

> Livestock is the largest source, responsible for 31% of the global total, according to Ilissa Ocko at the nonprofit Environmental Defense Fund (EDF) in New York City and her colleagues (Nature, 2021, p. 461)

!!! This is possibly good news for biochemical solutions? Since the largest source of methane is biological?

> Oil and gas operations rank a close second, releasing 26%. Other sources include landfills, coal mines, rice paddies and water-treatment plants. (Nature, 2021, p. 461)

> Reducing methane from livestock represents a particular challenge. People could eat less meat, but persuading people to change their diet is rarely straightforward. Moreover, meat consumption is rising in low- and middle-income countries — in line with rising incomes. (Nature, 2021, p. 461)

So maybe thats why in this case, technology could provide a unique solution... since demand for livestock is difficult to reduce.
