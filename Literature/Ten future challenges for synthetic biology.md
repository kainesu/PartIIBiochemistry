# Automatization and industralization

- Standardization of biological parts for reusability and ease of DNA assembly
    - Allows for scaling up to make many engineered cells and testing in parallel
- Automate Design-Build-Test-Learn (DBTL) cycle
- Codify experimental set ups
- Collate experimental metadata for traceability of errors that facilitate debugging
- Automate building and testing to give more time to learning and design

# Deep learning for DNA design

- Standardize DNA and treat DNA as modules in assemblies
- Use deep learning to write optimal DNA sequences for certain combinations of genetic parts and genetic contexts based on high-level commnands
- Improve deep learning based on concepts from evolution
    - Machine learning is analagous to trial-and-error process of mutation towards improvement
    - Could we also incorporate other concepts e.g. error detection, correction, sequence recombination?

# Designing whole cell simulations

- Using natural minimal cells to simulate effect of genes and proteins
- Mathematical models

# Biosensing

- Requires generalizable and modular architecture
- Biosensors can be used to detect various molecules e.g. DNA, RNA (toehold switches, CRISPR)
- We need better characterization of natural proteins, oligonucleotides, other macromolecules
- Riboswitch design
- Accurate protein structure prediction will be important
- We can also measure the differential gene expression of an organism in response to a stimuli of interest
    - Genetic logic circuits and recombinase-based memory systems can be engineered into cells to capture this gene expression pattern and convert them into a read-out
- Current challenges in biosensing
    - Longevity - lyophilisation, using stress-resistant biological constructs
    - Ease of use - biosensor should have minimal processing, autonomous, easy to deploy
    - Acquisition of data – colorimetric, smartphones, relaying info from biosensor to electronic units

# Real time precise control of evolution

- Engineering biology with evolution
- Design, predict, measure "evolutionary potential"

# Cellular communities and multicellularity

- Design differentiation and specialization of cells to enable effective division of labour in synthetic multicellular systems
- Using quorum sensing for intracellular communication

# Synthetic genomes

- May require whole cell simulations, deep learning from omics experiments

# Artificial cells

- Recreate basic functions of a living cell by combining biochemical components
- Produce artificial cells to acheive programmable synthetic mimics
- Understanding by constructing
- Xenobiology

# Engineered living materials

- Biology as a manufacturing discipline
- Micropatterning
- Advanced properties in living materials can be modified by genetic engineering
- Scalability is an issue

# Engineered organisms for sustainability

- Scaling up biotechnological processes for energy, manufacturing is an issue
- Engineering organisms need to subsist on cheaper feedstocks
