**Abstract:** A deeper mechanistic understanding of the saccharification of cellulosic biomass could enhance the efficiency of biofuels development. We report here the **real-time visualization of crystalline cellulose degradation by individual cellulase enzymes** through use of an advanced version of high-speed **atomic force microscopy**. Trichoderma reesei cellobiohydrolase I (TrCel7A) molecules were observed to slide unidirectionally along the crystalline cellulose surface but at one point exhibited collective halting analogous to a traffic jam. **Changing the crystalline polymorphic form of cellulose** by means of an ammonia treatment **increased the apparent number of accessible lanes on the crystalline surface and consequently the number of moving cellulase molecules**. Treatment of this bulky crystalline cellulose simultaneously or separately with T. reesei cellobiohydrolase II (TrCel6A) resulted in a remarkable increase in the proportion of mobile enzyme molecules on the surface. Cellulose was completely degraded by the synergistic action between the two enzymes.
