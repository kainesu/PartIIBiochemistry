## CH4 inhibitors 
> ==A CH4 inhibitor is a chemical compound that suppresses the activity of CH4 forming microbes (methanogens) in the rumen.== (Reisinger et al., 2021, p. 8)

> ==3-Nitrooxypropanol (3-NOP)== has been shown to consistently reduce CH4 emissions by around 30% in Total Mixed Ration (TMR) farm systems [66,67] without compromising animal productivity [68]and is expected to be commercially available in some countries within the next 2 years. 3-NOP has limited applicability in grazing systems as it decays within a few hours in the rumen, but its applicability could be extended to most dairy systems via slow-release formulations [69,70]. ==Research is also progressing into the use of 3-NOP in young ruminants to stimulate lifetime reductions== [71], and other inhibitors with longer rumen lifetimes and low dosage rates to allow bolus delivery [72,73]. (Reisinger et al., 2021, p. 8)

Lifetime reductions -> long-term! 

> In the absence of significant cobenefits for animal performance, adoption of CH4 inhibitors will depend on cost and, therefore, climate policy incentives or consumer demand. (Reisinger et al., 2021, p. 8)

## Methanogen vaccines 

> Vaccination against the rumen methanogens is expected to have broad applicability globally (Reisinger et al., 2021, p. 8)

> Research into a CH4 vaccine remains in the development phase and has not yet been demonstrated in live animals. (Reisinger et al., 2021, p. 8)

> However, all major components of a vaccine chain have been demonstrated: genome sequencing of methanogens has identified targets that stimulate antibody production; antibodies can be created by host animals and detected in saliva and the rumen; and those antibodies have been shown to suppress pure methanogen cultures in vitro [75–77]. The efficacy of a vaccine is necessarily speculative, but a reduction of 30% is considered plausible (Reisinger et al., 2021, p. 8)

> Vaccine adoption could be facilitated by administering it in combination with other widely used animal vaccines. However, adoption rates will depend not only on costs but also on veterinary practices, as many animal vaccines are not adopted fully even where proven to be cost-effective [78]. (Reisinger et al., 2021, p. 8)

## Seaweed 

> Algae of the genus *Asparagopsis* have been shown to reduce ruminant CH4 emissions by 20–98%, although the ==persistence of this effect over multiple seasons remains unclear== (Reisinger et al., 2021, p. 9)

> bromoform and bromochloromethane as active ingredients in Asparagopsis raises challenges... given that both substances are confirmed animal carcinogens and probable/possible human carcinogens (Reisinger et al., 2021, p. 9)

> Animal trials have detected residues in urine and milk [90], but no detrimental effects on meat quality [91]. There are also open questions regarding palatability to livestock, animal health and the ability to produce and supply seaweed at a large scale, especially to extensively grazed livestock (Reisinger et al., 2021, p. 9)

There seem to be a lot of questions about the effectiveness of seaweed additives. 

> produce bromoform cheaply via commercial chemical processes and provide it to animals directly and more consistently (e.g. via a bolus or other feed supplements) rather than through seaweed (Reisinger et al., 2021, p. 9)

## Alternative strategies 

> Cultured meat and dairy are relevant emerging substitutions [114,115], but availability and affordability for vulnerable populations remain open questions, and their overall climate impact compared to traditional farming depends on the time horizon considered and energy emissions [116]. (Reisinger et al., 2021, p. 11)

Limitation of using biochemistry to create alternative meats

> opportunities that can coexist with, rather than replace livestock systems and the rural communities dependent on them (Reisinger et al., 2021, p. 11)

it would be a great advantage if the biochemical solutions can be incorporated into existing farming systems, rather than displace the
