Similar to [[ReisingerEtAl_2021]] and [[SmithEtAl_2021]], so only including stuff that isn't already covered in those reviews since those are more updated. 

## Feed additives 
**Methane inhibitors**
- Bromochloromethane 
- 2-bromoethane sulfonate
- Chloroform
- Cyclodextrin 
- 3-nitro-oxypropanol 
- Questions about long-term efficacy – adaptation of rumen to inhibitors? 

**Electron receptors**
- Fumarate
- Nitrates
- Sulfates
- Nitroethane 
- Potential adaptation of rumen? 

**Ionophores**
- Monensin 

**Plant bioactive compounds**
- Tannins
- Saponins
- Essential oils 

**Exogenous enzymes**

**Direct fed microbials**
- Yeast-based products 
- Lactate-producing and lactate-using bacteria to promote more desirable intestinal microflora, stabilise pH, and promote rumen health 

**Manipulating rumen archaea and bacteria**
- Vaccines against rumen archaea 
	- Identifying genes encoding specific membrane proteins of *Methanobrevibacter ruminantium* (a rumen methanogen) 
	- E.g. antisera generated in sheep against subcellular fractions from *M. ruminantium*
- "Interventions in early life of animal can trigger differential microbial rumen colonisation and development" 
	- E.g. kids from does treated with BCM have reduced CH4 production (Abecia et al 2011)

**Dietary lipids** e.g. vegetable oil, animal fat 

The review concludes that "improving forage quality, optimizing rumen function for higher microbial protein synthesis through feeding of a balanced diet matching the physiological stage of the animal, and enhancing the overall efficiency of dietary nutrient use are the most efficient way of decreasing CH4 emissions per unit of animal product."
