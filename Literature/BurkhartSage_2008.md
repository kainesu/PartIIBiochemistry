**Abstract:** RB, the retinoblastoma protein, has been identified as a crucial tumour suppressor. It is believed to be directly or indirectly inactivated in nearly all human cancers.RB has been demonstrated to bind to over one hundred protein partners and has been shown to mediate transcriptional regulation of hundreds of target genes. These protein partners and transcriptional targets are thought to mediate the numerous cellular functions of RB, including temporary and permanent cell cycle arrest, genomic stability, apoptosis and differentiation.The cellular functions of RB, as well as a potential role in angiogenesis and metastasis, might contribute to its role as a tumour suppressor, but it is currently unknown which function is most critical. Distinct cellular functions of RB might contribute to its role in preventing tumour initiation versus its role in preventing tumour progression.The function of RB that is crucial for tumour suppression might also depend on in which type of cell RB is lost — stem cell, progenitor or differentiated cell — as well as in which tissue.In some contexts, presence of RB during earlier stages might be beneficial to tumour progression. Effects of post-translational modifications of RB on individual cellular functions might contribute to preference for a tumour to mutate RB or an upstream regulator.

# What is Rb? 
- A transcriptional co-factor that interacts with transcription factors to affect their function 
- An adaptor protein for chromatin remodelling enzymes 
- Not clear how all functions of Rb are involved in cancer 

# Cancer initiation 
**Rb is tumour suppressive by regulating the cell cycle** 
- Rb inhibits E2F TF activity 
- Rb controls stability of p27 cell cycle inhibitor by interacting with APC/C

# Early cancer progression 
**Rb promotes tumour growth?**
- Rb has been implicated in the prevention of E2F-mediated apoptosis in response to DNA damage, and could prevent tumour cell death (!)

# Late cancer progression 
**Rb is tumour suppressive**
- **Angiogenesis**. #experimental_evidence "deletion of Rb in a mouse model of Trp53-deficient squamous cell carcinoma demonstrates increased vascularization when compared to similar Trp53–/– tumours"
- **Metastasis**. May prevent metastasis, but mechanism unclear.  
	- #experimental_evidence "correlative analyses have suggested that changes in RB expression are significantly associated with invasion and metastasis of oesophageal cancers"
