## Importance of methane removal 

> the importance of CH4 as a greenhouse gas has been known about for many years, as reflected by the Kyoto protocol of 1997 [2] (Ming et al., 2022, p. 1)

> in November 2021, at the UN Climate Change Conference (COP 26) held in Glasgow, 105 participating countries signed “The Global Methane Pledge” committing to a 30% reduction in emissions from oil and gas by 2030 relative to 2020 [3] (Ming et al., 2022, p. 1)

> scientists and non-governmental organisations (NGOs) are calling for atmospheric CH4 removal [13,14] (Ming et al., 2022, p. 1)

methane action.

> ==In 2020, despite Covid-19 shutdowns, the annual increase in atmospheric CH4 was the largest recorded since 1983, when systematic measurements began== [16]. (Ming et al., 2022, p. 2)

## Non-global warming benefits of methane removal 

> ==CH4 removal also can help protect the ozone layer==, because one of the indirect effects of the rising concentrations of CH4 is the increasing amounts of water in the stratosphere, which participates in ozone layer depletion [19]. (Ming et al., 2022, p. 2)


> Lower surface ozone concentrations will increase crops yields and global photosynthesis, potentially allowing some CO2 removal (Ming et al., 2022, p. 6)

> co-benefits for human health are numerous [111], as it will reduce hospitalizations, asthma and pulmonary diseases and premature deaths due to the linked ozone pollution (Ming et al., 2022, p. 6)


> Due to warming oceans and surface air temperatures, several scientists perceive a risk of massive release of CH4 by destabilization of seafloor methane-hydrates [30–32] and Arctic permafrost thaw [33,34]. (Ming et al., 2022, p. 2)

> methanotrophs [36–39] whose populations rise with the increasing abundance of CH4 (Ming et al., 2022, p. 2)

negative feedback??? another advantage of biological methods

> Most anthropogenic CH4 emissions come from agriculture and waste management, which together constitute 60% of anthropogenic and 38% of total emissions. (Ming et al., 2022, p. 2)

Significant for biological interventions...

## Challenges for methane removal 

> has been diluted about 0.5 million times in an air volume of some 1.4 billion cubic kilometers. In addition, the relatively short life cycle of atmospheric CH4 (about 10 years) means that removal would have to be ongoing to reduce the concentration by a target amount. (Ming et al., 2022, p. 3)

## Advantage of methane removal compared to CO2 

> CH4 and other GHGs can be removed by in-situ oxidation, to products with no GWP or with much lower GWP than CH4 without the need of capture, separation, or storage. The oxidation reaction is exothermic and exergonic, and as such requires no minimum energy input once the activation energy is overcome (Ming et al., 2022, p. 3)


## Biochemical methods 
> bio-inspired aqueous-phase catalytic oxidation, bio-reactors containing methanogens, enzymatic systems (Ming et al., 2022, p. 3)

> Mitigation of landfill CH4 emissions using soil amendments such as biochar [94], and microbial CH4 oxidation processes with bio-covers [90] or bio-trickling filters are well-established methods [95]. Adding methanotrophs to flooded paddy soil also mitigates CH4 emissions [96]. (Ming et al., 2022, p. 5)

> Enhancing methanotrophic activity is among the mitigation methods proposed to prevent CH4 from reaching the atmosphere [44,45] (Ming et al., 2022, p. 5)

> planting trees that absorb tropospheric CH4 [98] in addition to CO2 (Ming et al., 2022, p. 5)

> Airborne microbes are abundant in the atmosphere [99] and subject to long-range transport [100], so it might be possible to enhance the amount of CH4 consuming microorganisms (methanotrophs) [101] for instance by enhancing the amount of methanotrophs already present on the bark of tree trunks [102]. (Ming et al., 2022, p. 5)

> Food modification – Cattle breeding to reduce enteric CH4 emissions. Among effective feed additives for beef–3-nitrooxypropanol and nitrates (respectively 22% and 14% CH4 reduction) Many other feeds are effective, but less: chestnut, coconut, grape pomace, linseed, red seaweed... The practice may not be generalizable. Probably low global impact. (Ming et al., 2022, p. 6)

biochemistry to understand how different feeds may reduce methane emissions from cows
