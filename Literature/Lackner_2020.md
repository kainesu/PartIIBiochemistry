> Methane removal poses two challenges: extreme dilution and competition from natural processes (Lackner, 2020, p. 357)

> An energy bill that is three orders of magnitude larger for a ton of methane would be prohibitive, and it is a good example of how Sherwood’s Rule—separation costs tend to scale linearly with dilution—can assert itself (Lackner, 2020, p. 357)

> However, it does not prohibit passive methods of removing methane. (Lackner, 2020, p. 357)

Are biochemical methods compatible with passive methods of removing methane?

> To substantially enhance natural processes, methane removal units would have to process the entire atmosphere in less than a decade. (Lackner, 2020, p. 357)

> methane just flows rapidly in and out of the atmospheric reservoir. If the water level in a bathtub with a wide-open drain is rising, turning down the faucet may be a better strategy than bailing. To compensate for unmanageable anthropogenic releases, it may be easier to curtail some natural emissions than to remove methane directly from the atmosphere. Once methane emissions are curbed, concentrations will decline rapidly. This stands in stark contrast to carbon dioxide emissions, which, by lingering, pose a stock (rather than a flow) problem (Lackner, 2020, p. 357)

May be more effective if the biochemical solutions can act at the source. This could be effective for biological sources of methane? E.g. cows.

> On the other hand, if climate feedbacks were to cause large methane releases from permafrost7, passive collectors at a massive scale may still be the best option available. (Lackner, 2020, p. 357)
