Main message: Some snake species have pit organs that are used to detect infrared radiation. These pit organs contain the ion channel TRPA1, which detects IR via the heat generated. 

Significance: 

Background: 
- Some snake species can detect infrared, which they use to detect endothermic predators or prey (i.e. animals that produce heat)
- These species have a pit organ in their faces that is part of the snake's nervous system 

Method: 
- Unbiased transcriptional profiling
