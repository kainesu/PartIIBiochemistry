- ASFV Pol X lacks two DNA-binding domains, the thumb domain and 8-KD domain in homologous proteins (in contrast to rPolB, which has these domains)
- dG-GTP mismatch is the most frequent mismatch for ASFV Pol X
- and Val120, Leu123 are nvolved in dG:dGTP misincorporation
- AsfvPolX is made up of 174 amino acids
- G-G is a Hoogsten base pair
- AsfvPolX can efficiently catalyze the gap-filling reaction towards various substrates, including recessed DNA and regular gapped DNA (the natural substrate of AsfvPolX)
    - Note: gapped DNA is the structure in the TGBE mechanism. However, does the TGBE DNA structure have a 5'P for the downstream oligo? (Yes)
- AsfvPol X binds to template DNA strand via 81CGERK85 (palm domain) and 135YKLNQY140 (finger domain)
    - Binding site of AsfvPolX contains three positvely charged residues (R84, K85, K136)
- The primer strand only forms 1 interaction with AsfvPolX, which is a H bond between NE2 atom of Gln98 and OP1 atom of C8 on the n-1' position
    - This contrasts with rPolB which also forms extensive interactions with the primer strand via the thumb domain, which is missing in AsfvPolX
- The 5'-phosphate (5'-P) group of the downstream oligo of the gapped DNA can greatly 
enhance the dG:dGTP misincorporation efficiency of AsfvPolX
    - Correct dGTP incorporation is 15x faster with 5'P present in 1nt gap substrates
    - In other PolX, 5'P is bound by 8-KD domain which is absent in PolX
- ASFV Pol X has a 5'-phosphate binding pocket that binds to 5'P of downstream oligo
    - Instead of using an 8-KD domain, AsfvPolX has a 5' PBS (in finger domain) that binds to 5'P
    - 5'P has highly positive charge — Two Arg residues (Arg125 and Arg168) and one Thr residue (Thr166) are involved in the pocket formation
    - While some other Pol X have one Arg residue (either an R corresponding to R125 or R corresponding to R168), only Asfv Pol X has two R
    - 5'PBS undergoes large structural changes when 5'P is absent (possible induced fit mechanism?)
- The 5'PBS enhances dGTP misincorporation efficiency
- AsfvPolX may be able to bypass the dG:dGTP lesion, and may also have some terminal transferase activity
- Under the study conditions, dG:dGTP misincorporation is slower than dG:dCTP, but under certain conditions, dG:GTP misincorporation could be as fast
- His115-Arg127 platform affects dG:dGTP misincorporation
    - His115 NE1 atom forms H bond with NE2 atom of R127
    - His115 forms hydrophobic interactions with dNTPs
    - R127 is highly conserved in PolX, but H115 may be replaced by other aromatic residues in homologous protiens (e.g. Tyr in rPolB an *Hs*PolB)
        - "A previous study showed that replacing His115 with Tyr115 could not maintain the dG:dGTP misincorporation activity of AsfvPolX; instead, it completely prevents the complex formation between Asfv-PolX and dG:dGTP mispair containing DNA molecules"
    - Two neighbouring Phe residues (F102, F116) may also be important by forming stacking interactions and packing against the H115 side chain
        - Corresponding residues in other Pol X (e.g. R258 and F272 in *Hs*PolB) do not interact with each other
    - Triphosphate groups of incoming dNTPs interact with cations in catalytic site
        - Triphosphate and 3'OH of dGTP interact with Ser39, Arg42, Asn48 of AsfvPolX
- Val120 and Leu123 impact dG:dGTP misincorporation; they interact with dGTP in G:G mismatches
    - Val120 forms extensive hydrophobic interactions with dG
    - Leu123 forms one hydrophobic interaction with dG, and it also has one interaction with the backbone O atom of H115
    - Val120 and Leu123 are both hydrophobic and are not found in other Pol X
- AsfvPolX is a highly distributive DNA polymerase

# Questions

Is AsfvPolX activity sequence context specific?
