# Differences with [[CherryEtAl_1999]]
- More sophisticated directed evolution method (Alt-PANCE) – mutagenesis and selection are done seamlessly within the same viral system (vs error-prone PCR – library is created, then tested with an assay in discrete steps)
- More gradual increases in selection stringency by varying 4 separate parameters 
- Evolving entire biosynthetic pathways (rather than just 1 specific enzyme)
- Directed evolution involved more rounds of selection and identification of more mutations 

PACE -> PANCE -> Alt-Pance (decreasing levels of stringency/selection pressure)

# Criticism  
- Increase in PylB concentration is a major factor contributing to increase in Pyl production. Could then similar increases be obtained by overexpressing PylB? e.g. using a more active promoter?
