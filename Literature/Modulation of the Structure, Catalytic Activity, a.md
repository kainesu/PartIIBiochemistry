- Reduced pol X is more accurate than oxidized Pol X
    - With gapped DNA substrates, insertion of dCTP opposite G by oxidized Pol X was only 13-fold more efficient than misinsertion of dGTP or dATP
    - Reduced pol X was 107 fold more efficient for insertion of dCTP opposie G than minsierintion of dGTP opposite G
- Host cell for ASFV (swine macrophage) has an oxidizing environment due to production of reactive oxygen species
