# Interdependence of cell growth and gene expression: origins and consequences

Note type: Source
Project: TORC1 signalling

- In bacteria, the rate of cell proliferation and the level of gene expression are coupled
- Specific growth rate = ln2/doubling time
- Making models → assigning physiological significance to each term via experiments
- RNA/protein ratio (r) increases with increasing translational inhibition
    - Compensation for reduced translational capacity (translation rate is slower, so more ribosomes have to be synthesised to maintain the same total amount of proteins synthesised)
    - Slow translation → buildup of intracellular amino acid pools → relief of repression of rRNA synthesis by ppGpp
