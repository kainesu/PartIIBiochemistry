# TLDR (abstract)

- The algae *Ostreococcus tauri* cannot grow without B1 and B12 present
- However, by coculturing it with a heterotrophic bacteria *Dinoroseobacter shibae*, it can survive without providing external B1 and B12
- *D shibae* itself cannot grow without B3, B7 and p-aminobenzoic acid (B9 precursor) provided, but *O taur* can provide thse vitamins
- A bioinformatics search of 197 marine bacteria genomes found 9 species that could function similarly as *D shibae* as a co-culture partner for *O tauri*
