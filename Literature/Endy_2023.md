Design -> Test -> Build -> Work 
- If testing is computational, then design and test can be combined into one step 

Comparison with UNIX. 
- Cells with minimal genomes still have 30% of genome with unknown function 

We need to learn how to build cells from scratch (learning by building)

Unlock "bio-code" that always works  

biology is a general purpose technology 

biology is universal 

climate opportunity 

local DNA printers

transmit information as DNA 
DNA into "empty cells" 
DNA = software
Cell = hardware?
