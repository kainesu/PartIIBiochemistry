## Fields

### Nanomedicine

#### Engineering better medicine

#### Stimuli-Responsive Drug Delivery Systems

**Conventional Release Mechanism**

·      Constant or exponential release over time

·      Responsive to ph or temperature change

o   Tumors are slightly acidic.

**Need for Stimuli-Responsive Drug Delivery**

·      Insulin delivery to patients with diabetes mellitus.

o   Insulin release in response to glucose concentration

o   Mimic physiological secretion (bioengineering)

**Glucose-Sensitive Polymers**

·      Tetravalent glucose-binding protein

**Tailoring of Insulin Delivery Nanoparticles**

_Glucose-sensitive polymers as insulin carrier_

·      Protect insulin to enable oral or nasal delivery

·      Degrade only at high blood glucose concentration

·      Insulin released upon polymer degradation.

·      Matrix degrades and releases insulin only in regions of high glucose concentration.

#### Green Tea Drug Carriers with Synergistic Effects

**What if the drug carrier also provides therapeutic effects?**

·      The drug ratio of carrier is no longer a restrictive issue

·      Synergistic therapeutic effects between the carrier and the drug

**EGCG as drug carrier**

·      Found in green tea! :D (Chin approves :P)

·      Anti-cancer, anti-oxidant, anti-inflammation, anti-microbial, anti-aging

·      High binding affinity to protein due to π-π stacking interactions between EGCG and protein

**Synthesis of EGCG Derivatives**

**Self-Assembly of Green tea nanocomplex**

·      Therapeutic protein + OEGCG + PEG-EGCG  Green tea catechin and therapeutic proteins

·      Oligomeric EGCG: Stabilizes micelle formation

·      Synergistic anti-cancer effect between proteins and EGCG

**Green Tea-Herceptin Micelles for cancer therapy**

·      Targets over expressed breast cancer cells

·      Green tea Herceptin micelles (Herceptin –MNC) is superior to Herceptin alone.

#### Antimicrobial Agents

**Drug resistance develops with use of conventional antibiotics**

·      Over 90 000 deaths per year in the US because of bacteria

·      Overuse/misuse of broad-spectrum antibiotics  rise in “superbugs”

·      MRSA  almost half of all skin infections

o   Super common in hospitals

o   Can die from it

·      Biofilms: Bacteria formation on surfaces of implanted and facilities, film of bacteria (eww)

·      Nosocomial infections per year in US

·      Treatment cost globally: $40 billion in 2010

·      Global market for personal care: $10B

**Novel Antimicrobial Agents**

·      Cationic peptide nanoparticles

·      Polyimidazolium Salt

o   Destroys Niger Membrane, lysing fungi cells and preventing cells from developing resistance

**Macromolecular Antimicrobial Agents**

·      Broad spectrum activity via membrane disruption

·      Rapid killing of microbial agents

·      Precludes development of resistance

·      Can kill gram positive and negative bacteria

·      Lysis of biofilm

·      Non-toxic, biodegradable, low cost, scalable

#### Functional Morphology of Kidney

·      Gomerulus

·      Proximal Tubule

**Biomimetic Artificial Kidney Device**

·      Hemodialysis

·      Nutrients Reabsorption

·      Development of suitable membranes and coatings

o   Porous, non-fouling

·      Can be used for filtering water :D (Chin approves)

### Green chemistry and energy

Provide access to clean water (Nanoporous membranes)

Sequestration of greenhouse gases (Nanocatalysts)

Making solar energy economical (Nanocomposites)

#### Capture and Storage of CO2

·      30 wt% aqueous monoethanolamine for CO2 capture

o   Requires heat treatment to release chemisorbed C02

o   Zeolites and MOF – expensive and don’t meet industrial requirements

·      Mesoporous poly-melamin- formaldehyde

o   Foam like structures with mesopores

o   Reversible CO2 absorption over mPMF

·      Conversion of Greenhouse gases

o   CO2  methanol

o   Green synthesis of Pharmaceuticals and Chemicals

#### Advanced Materials for Energy Applications

**Nanocomposites of metals, semiconductors and oxides**

**Batteries**

o   High power density (fast discharging rate), good cyclability

o   High energy density (high capacity)

o   SiO2 nanocages for Lithium ion battery applications

o   High theoretical capacity

o   Inexpensive and abundant raw materials

o   Expensive used as a template

o   Cannot be removed without annealing

### Cell and tissue engineering

### Biodevices and diagnostics

#### Early diagnosis of diseases (nanodevices)

#### Molecular diagnostics systems

Tissue/Cell Lysis  molecular extraction and purification ( DNA/RNA  amplification  detection) ( protein  detection)

**MicroKit: Lab on a chip**

·      Cheap (less than $1)

·      Rapid sample preparation and diagnosis (less than 2h)

·      Fully automatic lab on cartridge system with RNA/DNA extraction and 3-channel real-time PCR for rapid disease diagnosis

·      A compact desktop system

·      Disposable, self-contained reagents

**Cancer Diagnosis**

·      Conventional treatment is difficult and expensive

·      Circulating tumor cells (CTCs)

·      Liquid biopsy  isolation of rare CTCs from peripheral blood for cancer diagnosis, monitoring.

o   Microsieve fluidic device provides excellent and much more rapid CTC recovery (holes in microsieve 10 micrometres, CTCs slightly larger than normal blood cells)

o   Superior to commercial FDA-approved devices

o   Fully automated system for isolation, enumeration, and biomarker analysis of CTC.

§  Non invasive, near real time, inexpensive, accurate personalized cancer management

§  Single cell analysis  new biomarker

**Case Study: Patient receiving futile targeted therapy**

·      IBN microsieve produces more accurate results than commercially available technology.

·      E.g. Glyoma
