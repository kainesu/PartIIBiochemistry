- The authors use a diffusion model to allow for protein structure generation given a user-specified semantic input (similar to AI art generators)
- It can generate complex structures with little similarity to known protein structures
- Could generate higher order symmetric oligomers 
- Was able to outperform existing machine learning models in the majority of 25 design challenges in designing scaffolding protein structural motifs for binding and catalytic functions 
- It could also scaffold enzyme active sites, and scaffold repetitive regions arranged in a symmetric way e.g. trimeric viral glycoproteins 
- Design putative protein binders, including to flexible helical peptides that are often challenging to design binders for – demonstrated success for Bim and PTH, including experimentally
