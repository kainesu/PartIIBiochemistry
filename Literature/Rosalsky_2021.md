-   We should tax stock trading — suggested 0.1% per trade to limit high frequency trading
    -   Idea is to discourage traders from making frivolous bets
    -   Traders would be encouraged to put more thought into their investments so they only invest in companies they truly believe will be profitable
-   But some argue that it will only cause trade to move to other countries, and will not raise much money
    -   To me this sounds like a weak argument. Why would they move to other countries when the stock is not available there? But idk
-   For such a tax to be successful, it may be key to extend the tax to all firms of the country regardless of where it is based — British tax was successful, but not Swedish tax
-   May also be important for tax to be high enough to discourage frivolous trades — in US, tax is only 0.00051%, vs 0.1% suggested by economists and 0.5% in UK
