- PolB has two domains, a dRP lyase in the 8kD domain and nucleotide transfer activity in the 31 kDa domain
- PolB has several motis that enhance interaction with gapped DNA substrates: two helix-hairpin-helix motifs in 8kDa and thumb subdomains, and carboxylate residues in the palm subdomain
- I260Q misincorporates nucleotides at a higher rate due to decreased level of dNTP discrimination during binding
- D246V, M282L have been shown to be mutagenic
- E295K, U260M, P242R have been linked to cancer
- I260Q maps to the hydrophobic hinge region between the palm and fingers subdomain
    - The hinge region is known to influence PolB ability to discriminate between nucleotides
    - Hydrophobic hinge contains residues I174, L194, T196, I260, Y265, F272
    - Relative motion of fingers subdomain about hinge affects fidelity
- I260Q mutation inserts a polar side chain into the hydrophobic hinge region decreases the flexibility of the hinge region
    - Coordination of water molecules in hydrophobic hinge region around Q260 → water molecules may need to be expelled before fingers subdomain can close around substrate
- In I260Q, altered positioning of R258, Y271, F272 increases the volume of the dNTP binding pocket → mutant may be able to accommodate mismatched nucleotides more readily than wt
