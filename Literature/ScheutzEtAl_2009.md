## About methanotrophs 
> Oxidation of CH4 by aerobic methanotrophs is initiated by MMO enzymes. MMOs utilize two reducing equivalents to (Scheutz et al., 2009, p. 414)

> split the O–O bond in O2. One of the O2 atoms is reduced to form H2O, while the other is incorporated into CH4 to form methanol (Figure 3). (Scheutz et al., 2009, p. 415)

> Methanol is oxidized to formaldehyde by a periplasmic methanol dehydrogenase (MDH) (Figure 3). Most of the reducing power required for the metabolism of CH4 is produced by oxidation of formaldehyde via formate to CO2. There are multiple enzyme systems for the oxidation of formaldehyde to formate in methylotrophs. An example is the NAD(P)-linked aldehyde dehydrogenase. Formate is oxidized to CO2 by a NAD-dependent formate dehydrogenase in most if not in all methanotrophs. Formaldehyde produced from the oxidation of CH4 and methanol by methanotrophs is assimilated to form intermediates of the central metabolic routes that are subsequently used for biosynthesis of cell material. (Scheutz et al., 2009, p. 415)

> Two pathways for synthesis of cell materials from formaldehyde are known: the serine and the ribulose monophosphate (RuMP) pathway. In the RuMP pathway (used by Type I methanotrophs) one ATP is used in the formation of one glyceraldehyde-3-P from three formaldehyde molecules whereas in the serine pathway (used by type II methanotrophs) three ATP and two NADH are needed to assimilate two formaldehydes and one CO2. The RuMP pathway is thus more efficient than the serine pathway. Consequently, type I methanotrophs tend to outgrow their type II counterparts, unless inorganic N or Cu limitation provides an advantage for type II species, expressing sMMO or nitrogenase activity. (Scheutz et al., 2009, p. 415)

> Most methanotrophic bacteria are obligate methanotrophs and strict aerobes (Hanson & Hanson 1996). Their activity depends on the presence of sufficient concentrations of both CH4 and O2 (Scheutz et al., 2009, p. 415)

### Methanotrophs in landfill soils 
> Landfill cover soils can develop a high capacity for CH4 oxidation by selection of methanotrophic bacteria (Scheutz et al., 2009, p. 416)

> CH4 oxidation is controlled by a number of environmental factors (Scheutz et al., 2009, p. 419)

> field emission measurements in tropical zones are lacking (Scheutz et al., 2009, p. 437)

> Existing data have shown that emission rates vary spatially and temporally (Scheutz et al., 2009, p. 437)

> over several orders of magnitude (Scheutz et al., 2009, p. 439)
