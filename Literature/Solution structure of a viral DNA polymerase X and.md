- African swine fever virus DNA polymerase X (ASFV Pol X) catalyes nucleotide mispair formation with comparable efficiency to Watson-Crick base pair formation
    - K_(d,app) for dGTP in G-G base pair is 35μM vs 260μM for dCTP in G-C (i.e. dGTP in G-G is bound more tightly than dCTP)
- ASFV DNA ligase is also tolerant of bulky G-G mismatches
- Pol X structure closely resembles fingers and palm domain of Pol B
- The carboxylate triad in the active site is also very similar to that of Pol B
- Pol X residues 18–28 form a β-hairpin (strands β2 and β3) that interacts with residues 69–71 (β7) to form a three-stranded β-sheet. In contrast,  the corresponding regions in Pol β are α-helical
- The three major loops in Pol β (between β4–αL and β6–β7 in the palm, and β8–β9 in the fingers) correspond to tight turns in Pol X, resulting in a slightly more compact structure for Pol X
- Pol X has a disulfide bond between Cys81 and Cys86
    - Whether the disulfide bond is present *in vivo* is not yet known
    - However, the disulfide bond might be biologically relevant for Pol X
- Pol X binds to gapped DNA at least as tightly as Pol B, and may have even higher binding affinity
    - This may be due to the binding pocket and outer wall of the fingers subdomain of Pol X being much more electropositive than in Pol B. E.g. Lys 131, 136 replace Leu 287, Thr 292 in Pol B
- The low fidelity of DNA pol X may be due to changes in DNA structure that are required for it to bind to Pol X
    - A larger space is created for a bulky, nascent base pair
    - Or, the template base is positioned such that it is sterically + electronically complementary to a mismatched incoming nucleotide
- ASFV ligase seals G-G mismatch-containing nicks at 10% efficiency at which it seals the corresponding G-C containing nick
    - vs mammalian ligases I and III which discriminate fairly strongly against nicks in purine-purine mismatches
