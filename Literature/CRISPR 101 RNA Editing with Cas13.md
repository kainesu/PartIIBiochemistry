**What is Cas13b**

Cas13b is an RNA-targeting CRISPR enzyme

**RNA editing advantages**

- RNA editing does not require HDR → can be done in non-dividing cells
- Cas13 enzymes don't require PAMs, but some Cas13 enzymes prefer targets with a single base protospacer flanking sequence (PFS)
- Do not edit genome directly as they lack RuvC and HNH domains

**LwaCas13a**

- Does not require a PFS
- Not stably folded – must be stabilized by monomeric superfolded GFP and averages only ~50% RNA lockdown

**PspCas13b**

- Cas13b from *Prevotella sep.*
- Does not require PFS
- 62.9% average knockdown
- Sensitive to mismatches in target RNA from bases 12-26 of a 30nt target sequence
- PspCas13b-ADAR2dd (E488Q) had robust editing with various spacer lengths from 30-84nt, with 50nt spacers increasing editing efficiency but also increasing off-target editing within the target window which may be due to longer stretches of duplexed DNA
