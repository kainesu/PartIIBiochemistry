# Singapore's environmental commitments

**2020 pledge set in 2009**

- Singapore's 2020 pledge (set in 2009) - reduction of GHG emissions by 16% below BAU levels in 2020, contingent on a global legally binding agreement
    - As paris agreement came into existence in 2015, we now commit to 16%
- Unconditional pledge of 7-11% below 2020 BAU levels

We do not have numbers for 2020 pledge bc sg only submits x-4 details each year 

2030 pledge **- set in 2015 as an INDC and resubmitted as NDC in 2016**

- Reduce emissions intensity by 36% from 2005 levels
    - Why did we choose 2005 as a baseline
        - was not spelt out in the document. NDC did not ask for explanation of baseline, just wanted countries to come to the table.
        - moving forward there are guidelines on how to account for NDCs. "encourages countries to submit from 2020"
        - from 2nd NDC onwards, must explain how baseline was chosen.
        - Just a guess: before we switched from fuel oil to natural gas ⇒ higher baseline → more time to achieve target. many developed countries chose 1990s — pre-soviet Bloc, as a group, emissions was very high.
        - China also chose 2005 which was after a few years of high economic growth. Like losing weight lol our baseline is when we are heaviest
- Stabilize emissions with aim of peaking around 2030
- Set in 2020 (update to NDC): peak emissions at 65 MtCO2 around 2030
- We will be updating NDC in 2025 again and every 5 years from there

# **Long term low emissions development strategy**

Beyond 2030, we aspire to halve emissions from peak to 33 MtCO2e by 2050 with view to achieve net zero emissions as soon as viable in 2050 onwards

- Transform industry, economy, society
- Draw on technology
- International power grids

# Are we making progress on our emissions?

we can't manage what we don't measure. 

- Our 2018 progress was short of target emissions abatement by 2020 in power generation, industry, transport — we don't have 2020 numbers (not publicly available), so dk if we met it in 2020
    - Why is it not made publicly available

# Supporting 2030 SDGs

- IMC-SDG co-chaired by MFA and MSE
- South-South capacity building — SG is not a global south country (?)
- We have a dedicated SDG webpage since Sept 2019 — live update on our progress towards SDGs
- Voluntary national review report
    - Encompasses more issues than SDGs - 31 agencies produced this versus 25 in climate action plan

# Singapore green plan

- Parliament recognized climate change as a global emergency
    - Read full report: https://sprs.parl.gov.sg/search/fullreport?sittingdate=01-02-2021
- Green Plan builds on existing measures
- Important — ministries are collaborating to push green plan
- Green Government goes beyond pstl — plans for government to go carbon neutral
- will meet 2030 goals, but is it enough?

## New goals

### Transport

- New registration of diesel cars and taxis from 2025
- 8 EV ready towns with chargers at all HDB carparks by 2025
    - Targets equity issue
    - >80% of singaporeans live in HDBs
- All new car and taxi registrations to be of cleaner energy models from 2030
    - COEs last 10 years
- 60K charging points nationwide

Should we be encouraging EVs or should we be encouraging people to be walking and taking public transport? 

- weather
- aspirations

Many concerns about buying EV 

No range anxiety

Charging could take longer than refuelling 

**Supported by** 

- Raising of petrol duty rates with series of rebates for certain sectors e.g. delivery
- Adjustment of road tax bands to enable mass market electric car buyers to maximize rebates from EV early adoption incentive
- Lower additional registration fee floor to 0 for EVs from Jan Dec 2022 to Dec 2023
- $30m set aside for EV-related initiatives over next 5 years

Transport is an important contributor to SG emissions!

If we move from fuel vehicles to EVs, emissions moves upstream to power plants (how to solve this?) 

### New targets at CoS 2021

- Reduce waste sent to landfill per capita per day by 20% by 2026 with goal of 30% by 2030
- MOE: Reduce net carbon emissions from schools by 2/3, at least 20% to be carbon neutral by 2030
    - Eco-stewardship programme
- [GreenGov.SG](http://greengov.SG) initiative - extension of public sector taking the lead in environmental sustainability
- Issue green bonds on select public infrastructure projects
- Enterprise Sustainability Programme

## Energy

Singapore is alternative energy disadvantaged

- Solar probably most viable
- Investing in low emissions solutions — at least $49m under RIE 2030
- MoUs on cooperation on low emissions solutions
- If we import renewable energy, we become vulnerable to geopolitical and economic shifts of a new energy supply chain. Energy security

## Domestic opportunities and challenges

- Leverage green finance and private sector to develop solutions
- Greater coordination needed among ministries — MEWR pivoting to ministry of sustainability and environment
- Climate education
- Ensuring inclusive, climate-resilient transition
    - Job cuts from fossil industry. SG is reliant on fossil fuel industry.
    - Petrol hikes and higher costs due to carbon tax
        - Is petrol hike really an equity issue? Isn't mostly middle class and rich ppl with cars? — some gig economy workers e.g. delivery riders

singapore must maintain economic competitiveness and global relevance 

**messaging** 

- "Classic virtues" - temperance, gentle sacrifice, restraint, would it help ppl to understand?
    - Places responsibility more on individual action than systemic change, which is more important in driving large reductions
    - Conservation
- shifting will see 15% efficiency improvement
    - in sg, renewable energy cannot be deployed at utility scale.
    - even if we deploy solar panels across rooftops it will not be at utility scale ⇒ we can enver replace fossil fuels entirely
    - there will def not be enough renewable energy to offset this shift
    - we shld look forward to pure solar charging stations: ppl who choose to go EV can actually go to a pump that is powered by the sun.
        - No guarantee that the charging station electricity is from renewables haha unless its obviously solar powered
    

reporting in sg is a bit slow. our reporting is biannual not annual 

SGP is underpinned by much of R&D funding — our universities vie for global funding too 

will we choose renewable energy from environmentally friendly countries? e.g. mining metals is environmentally friendly + socially responsible? hydropower causing environmental destruction?

- if we import clean energy, it should be a cleaner source than what we are using here? otherwise we are just transferring the emissions elsewhere. we shouldn't cause environmental or livelihood issues elsewhere
- Power integration plan Laos/SG/Malaysia
    - Hard to set standards for other countries due to sovereignty issues
- Finance is moving through SG to fund coal in laos and other countries
- Questions of accountability
    - Banks
    - Financial institutions
    

green plan has focus on green finance etc. but what about getting current financial institutions to divest? Are there any challenges?  

people will need to accept a higher cost of living for conservation  

Singapore ALREADY imports fuel sources for power generation. but to import renewable energy, we will need to look to different sources, and are these sources going to be environmentally friendly?
