**Abstract:** Translation initiation proceeds in several steps, and one of the early events involves the binding of three initiation factors, mRNA and initiator tRNA to the 30S ribosomal subunit, which is known as the 30S pre-initiation complex (PIC) assembly. Systematic FRET studies now uncover the kinetically favored assembly pathway of the 30S PIC.
