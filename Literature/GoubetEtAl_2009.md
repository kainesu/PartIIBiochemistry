# Main findings
- Investigated role of CSLA proteins in mannan polysaccharide synthesis in Arabidposis by studying glucomannan in mutants of each member of the family of 9 CSLA genes 
	- Knockout CSLA gene → examine effect on mannan polysaccharide levels in Arabidposis stem sections via immunofluorescence 
- Cellulose synthase-like A family (CSLA) proteins are responsible for glucomannan synthesis *in vivo*
- Used CSLA mutants to characterise their function
- CSLA2, 3, 9 responsible for synthesis of all detectable glucomannan in Arabidopsis stems
- CSLA7 synthesises glucomannan in embryos 

- Plant cell walls consist of a hemicellulose-cellulose network embedded in a matrix of pectins and proteins 
- Abundance, type of cross-linking hemicellulose varies between primary and secondary walls, within different plant tissues, and between species 
- Primary cell walls of dicots are mainly composed of [[Xyloglucan]] 
- Gymnosperm secondary cell walls are mainly composed of [[Mannans]] 
- Glucomannan = β-1,4-linked glucosyl and mannosyl residues in the backbone 
- Heterologous expression and characterisation of CSLs has helped to elucidate their functions, e.g. heterologous expression of a rice CSLF in Arabidopsis led to detectable mixed linkage glucan synthesis 
- Galactoglucomannan oligos can inhibit auxin induced stem elongation in peas, pine stem segments
