A low-processivity or “distributive” polymerase extends a population of templates in a noticeably different manner than a processive polymerase. A highly distributive polymerase binds to a template, adds a couple of nucleotides, and dissociates, leaving a population of templates that can be extended equally with time. A highly processive polymerase binds a template and extends with longer binding events.
