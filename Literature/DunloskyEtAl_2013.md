# High utility strategies
- Distributed practice – instead of studying all the material at once, break it up into smaller chunks and study over a longer period of time 
- Practice testing – same as **active recall**. Recall can be **cued** ("hinting") or **free**. 

# Moderate utility strategies
- Elaborative interrogation
- Self-explanation
- Interleaved practice

# Low utility strategies
- Summarization
- Highlighting
- Keyword mnemonic
- Imagery use for text learning
- Rereading
	- However *spaced* rereading may improve the effect of rereading on learning.
