- Cas13b has a double-sided protospacer-flanking sequence
- bzCas13b has a 5' PFS of A, U or G, and a 3' PFS or NAN or NNA
- bzCas13b exclusively cleaves ssRNA with both direct repeat architectures
- bzCas13b cleaves at pyrimidine residues with a strong preference for uracil; this activity is abolished in the presence of EDTA â‡’ divalent metal ion dependent mechanism for RNA cleavage
- bzCas13b exhibits collateral cleavage of non-targeted RNA, but only in the presence of target RNA
- RNA accessibility matters the most in the protospacer region most distal to the direct repeat of the crRNA
- *csx27* represses and *csx28* enhances cas13b activity
