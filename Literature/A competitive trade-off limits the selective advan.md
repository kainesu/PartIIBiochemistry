# TLDR

Antibiotic-producing microbes have to optimize the amount of antibiotics they produce. Antibiotics inhibit sensitive competitors. However, producing too much benefits resistant colonies which can then outcompete the producer because they don’t have to produce their own antibiotics to kill off sensitive competitors. 

The authors co-cultured fluorescently-labeled E. Coli that can produce colic in with non-producing resistant and sensitive strains. 

The advantage of the producers increases non-monotonically with the amount of production (I.e. the increase begins to drop off and eventually starts to decrease. It’s a peak.) 

# Background

- For antibiotic producers to evolve, the environment has to be spatially structured and shouldn’t be well-mixed
    - If well-mixed, then the antibiotics will mix around and could be too dilute to be inhibitory
    - Also, resistant strains further away from the producers can benefit from the antibiotics without additional cost (“freeloaders”/cheaters)
    - On the other hand if the environment is spatially structured, antibiotics are concentrated in the local vicinity.
- However, spatial structuring does not guarantee enhancement of antibiotic production
- Authors aim to determine the conditions that result in selection for antibiotic production. How does the amount of antibiotic produce affect the selective advantage it confers?

# Method

TLDR

- Create three strains: antibiotic producing, antibiotic-resistant, and antibiotic-sensitive
- Each strain is labeled with a plasmid with a different fluorescent reporter so that abundance can be measured by measuring fluorescence
- Selection for antibiotic production is defined as the final ratio of producers to cheaters. (So a higher ratio → more producers → there is a selective advantage to production.)

# Questions

- Did the authors also explore the possibility of overproduction of antibiotics leading to an evolutionary response in the surrounding strains? So even if their competitors were sensitive at first, they evolve to become resistant? etc?
