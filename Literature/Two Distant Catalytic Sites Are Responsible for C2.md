- The LshC2c2-crRNA complex has a bilobed structure
- NUC lobe contains two HEPN domains, a linker that connects the two HEPN, and a Helical-2 domain
- REC lobe contains an N-terminal domain (NTD) and a Helical-1 domain
- HEPN1 and HEPN2 domains are positioned side by side to resemble an X-shape such that the catalytic R-X(4-6)-H motifs from HEPN1 and HEPN2 domains form a composite symmetric active pocket
- The four catalytic residues in HEPN domains are located at the external concave surface
- crRNA of C2c2 possesses a central seed region
    - 5' end spacer of LshC2c2-associated crRNA is concealed inside the protein, while the central region of the C2c2 crRNA spacer is exposed to the bulk solvent → target RNA can bind to this region to form guide RNA-target RNA duplex
- C2c2 guide strand undergoes a conformational change upon base pairing with target RNA to form a rigid guide-RNA-target RNA duplex
    - C2c2 also likely changes conformation to accommodate this change
- The RNA-guided RNA target cleavage site in the HEPN domains is located on the outer surface of C2c2 → could affect cleavage pattern of C2c2
- C2c2 cuts RNA in a more promiscuous manner than other Cas proteins
    - Since target cleavage occurs on the outer surface of C2c2 away from the guide-target RNA duplex region, the target RNA may reach the HEPN catalytic site through an external binding channel in C2c2
    - The external catalytic site may also allow for cooperative cleavage of target RNA by multiple C2c2 molecules
- C2c2-catalyzed crRNA-guided target cleavage depends on a non-G 3' PFS
    - The 3'-flanking region of the crRNA repeat, together with the downstream spacer, adopts a single-stranded form with a modest kink between nucleotides (-1) and (+1)
