- The Asgard archaea *Lokiarchaeum ossiferum* has many cell surface protrusions, which was predicted by the "inside out model" of eukaryogenesis, where archaea engulfed bacteria
- I think it's interesting that cell surface protrusions was a prediction, does it make engulfment more possible? 
- I wonder if this could form the basis of a [[Directed Evolution]] method where engulfment becomes a method for take up of new mutations or functionalities... 
- Authors also used [[A5 Preparing membrane proteins for structural study#^a0caf0|Cryo-ET]] as one method to visualise the internal structures of *L ossiferum*, demonstrating the increasing use of the method in various areas of molecular/cell biology 
	- Both *Prometheoarchaeum syntrophicum*, the first Asgard species to be cultured in the lab, and *L ossiferum* grow together with other prokaryotic organisms, in *syntrophy*. 
		- This might provide lessons for [[Synthetic Ecology]]
