# Primer design

- Forward primer and reverse primer
- 20-30 nucleotides
- 40-60% GC content
- Both forward and reverse primers must have a similar melting temperature (within 2°C of each other)
- Check for mis-priming and secondary structure!
    - In benchling – below 10 kcal is good
- Try to end with a G/C at 3' end
- Avoid long runs of single bases

# Biobricks

- iGem-created standard biological parts
- Can be imported directly into Benchling

# Golden Gate assembly

1. Think about what sequence needs to bind 
    1. make sure sequences are as diverse as possible so they dont anneal to each other 
2. Add restriction cut sites — with some random bases at the ends so that it's long enough for the RE to bind

Questions

- Should we put multiple genes on the same plasmid or on separate ones?
    - Don't want too many plasmids in a cell
    - Also with just one plasmid, only need one selection marker and promoter (polycistronic)
