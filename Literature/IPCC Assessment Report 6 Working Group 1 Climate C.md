- Global surface temperatures will increase until at least the mid-century under **all emissions scenarios considered**
- Global warming of 1.5°C and 2°C will be exceeded during the 21st century unless deep reductions in CO2 and other greenhouse gas emissions occur
    - Very low GHG emissions - 1.0-1.8 increase
    - Intermediate emissions - 2.1-3.5
    - High emissions - 3.3-5.7
- With increasing global warming, there will be
    - an increase in frequency and intensity of hot extremes, marine heatwaves, heavy precpitation, agricultural and ecological droughts, tropical cyclones;
    - reductions in Arctic sea ice, snow cover, permafrost
    - Increased variability in global water cycle, increased global monsoon precipitation, increased severity of wet and dry events
- Ocean and land carbon sinks will be less effective at slowing the accumulation of CO2 in the atmosphere under scenarios with increasing CO2 emissions
    - With increasing cumulative CO2 emissions, the proportion of emissions that can be taken up by land and ocean will decrease ⇒ higher proportion of emitted CO2 will remain in the atmosphere
- Some changes due to past and future GHG emissions will be irreversibel for centuries to millennia:
    - Global ocean is committed to future warming, upper ocean stratification, ocean acidification, ocean deoxygenation
    - Melting of mountain and polar glaciers, loss of permafrost carbon, continued ice loss from Greenland ice sheetts
    - Increase in global mean sea level
- Limiting human-induced global warming will require limiting cumulative CO2 emissions, reaching **at least net zero CO2 emissions** along with **strong reductions in other GHG emissions**
    - Each 1000 GtCO2 of cumulative CO2 emissions likely will cause a 0.27°C to 0.63°C increase in global surface temperature (best estimate 0.45°C)
    - Reaching net zero anthropogenic CO2 emissions is required to stabilize human-induced global temperature increase at any level; but limiting global temperature increase to a **specific level** requires limiting cumulative CO2 emissions within a carbon budget
- Anthropogenic CO2 removal has the potential to remove CO2 from the atmosphere and durably store it in reservoirs
    - If CO2 removal leads to global net negative emissions, atmospheric CO2 concentrations can be lowered and ocean acidification could be reduced
    - Even if global net negative CO2 emissions is achieved and sustained, while global CO2 induced surface temperature increase could be reversed, other climate changes would continue (e.g. global mean sea level rise)
- Achieving global net zero CO2 emissions is necessary to stabilize CO2 induced global surfacea temperature increase
- A very low or low GHG emissions scenario would have rapid and sustained effects to limit human-caused climate change; however the early response of the climate system can be masked by natural variability
    - The same scenarios would strongly limit the change of several CIDs e.g. increase in frequency of extreme sea level events
