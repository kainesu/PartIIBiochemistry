- There seems to be a distinction between methane removal from the atmosphere and methane mitigation from point sources (e.g. landfills)
- There are also different ways of deploying microbes for methane removal e.g. in biotrickling filters, on solid state polymers, etc. 
- Removing methane from the atmosphere broadly seems to be more challenging than from point sources due to the lower methane concentration 
- Concentration is a problem. Could be overcome by biochemical methods – some enzymes can act on low concentrations of methane by being highly specific and having high affinity?

> As the dominant global source of anthropogenic methane, agricultural emissions are attributable primarily to cattle, sheep, and other ruminants, rice farming, and managing manures and waste. Methane emissions from agriculture continue to rise (figure 1), driven by global increases in total and per capita meat consumption as global population and wealth grow (Jackson et al., 2021, p. 2)

> Dietary supplements such as essential oils and red algae can reduce methane emissions from individual cattle and sheep, but they sometimes do so at the expense of feed digestion and fermentation efficiency [11]. For rice farming, a meta-analysis of 52 studies found that non-continuous flooding reduced methane emissions by 53% on average compared to continuously flooded paddies; however, nitrous oxide (N2O) emissions increased by 105% and yield decreased by 4% [12]. (Jackson et al., 2021, p. 2)

perhaps biochemistry can create a solution that mitigates these trade-offs, either by dealing with the side effects or reducing methane emissions in a way that does not produce these side effects.

> Earth-system feedbacks could rapidly increase methane emissions from natural systems (Jackson et al., 2021, p. 3)

> Eliminating most anthropogenic methane emissions is unlikely this century, and sudden methane release from the Arctic or elsewhere cannot be excluded, so technologies for negative emissions of methane may be needed. (Jackson et al., 2021, p. 3)

> CH4 can be oxidized catalytically, without the need for capture (Jackson et al., 2021, p. 4)

> such a reaction is difficult at typical conditions of atmospheric temperature and pressure (Jackson et al., 2021, p. 4)

> Because of methane’s potency as a greenhouse gas (34 times higher Global Warming Potential (GWP) than CO2 on a century timescale and 86 times higher on a 20-year timescale, [30]), considerably less methane removal is needed to realize the same climate impact. (Jackson et al., 2021, p. 4)

> relative scarcity of methane in the atmosphere leads to a higher minimum energy requirement for methane removal compared to CO2 (Jackson et al., 2021, p. 4)

> goal in a system meant to separate methane from air is to isolate dilute methane from the ambient air and separate it into a higher purity stream that can later be oxidized (Jackson et al., 2021, p. 4)

> As the concentration of methane increases, the minimum work of separation decreases. This fact emphasizes that addressing higher concentration sources first is desirable (Jackson et al., 2021, p. 5)

> A dairy farm, where methane concentrations can be as high as 1000 times the average atmospheric concentration [36], is representative of a sector where methane emissions may be relatively difficult to eliminate, and methane oxidation could be strategic to employ. (Jackson et al., 2021, p. 5)

> Biological approaches for CO2 removal include reforestation/afforestation, soil carbon (Jackson et al., 2021, p. 5)

> sequestration, biomass energy with carbon capture and storage and ocean iron fertilization (Jackson et al., 2021, p. 6)

> chemical or physical approaches include direct air capture of CO2 from ambient air, enhanced mineral weathering and enhanced ocean alkalinity (Jackson et al., 2021, p. 6)

> For each of these technologies, research is needed on its cost, technological efficiency, scaling and energy requirements, social barriers to deployment, co-benefits and potential negative by-products. (Jackson et al., 2021, p. 6)

Factors to consider for biological approaches as well.  
  
It might be useful to create a summary table in the essay to compare methods side by side? IN order to emphasies the advantages and drawbacks of biochemical approaches compared to others

> Microbes provide the second-largest natural sink for atmospheric methane of approximately 40 Tg methane annually [5]. (Jackson et al., 2021, p. 7)

> At least two microbial groups, anaerobic archaea and aerobic methanotrophic bacteria, possess enzymes that oxidize methane: methane monooxygenase and methyl coenzyme M reductase (Jackson et al., 2021, p. 7)

bacterial engineering  
  
enzyme engineering

> embed enzymes within three-dimensionally printed polymers that demonstrated promise in maintaining their stability (Jackson et al., 2021, p. 7)

> Consortia of microbes have also been shown to couple the direct, anaerobic oxidation of methane to denitrification of nitrate, raising the potential of multi-gas mitigation (Jackson et al., 2021, p. 7)

> Biologically mediated methane-to-methanol conversions are of particular interest in wastewater treatment systems where methanol is used to enhance denitrification rates (Jackson et al., 2021, p. 7)

> Enhanced microbial oxidation of methane in agricultural and other soils or in artificial substrates (e.g. biotrickling filters) is a microbially based approach for methane mitigation or atmospheric removal (Jackson et al., 2021, p. 7)

> Han et al.[61] showed that amendments of biochar derived from rice straw reduced methane emissions from paddy soils by 40% in microcosm experiments (Jackson et al., 2021, p. 7)

> Sulfate additions have also been shown to reduce methane emissions from rice paddies (Jackson et al., 2021, p. 7)

> Miller et al.[63] demonstrated that iron and humic acid amendments significantly suppressed in situ net methane fluxes by 26% in Arctic Alaska peatland soils, likely by enhancing alternative electron acceptor availability. (Jackson et al., 2021, p. 7)

example of biochemistry being used to understand the mechanism for this solution i.e. enhancing alternative acceptor availability

> Biotrickling filters (Jackson et al., 2021, p. 8)

> Yoon et al.[64] modelled the feasibility of a biotrickling filtration system using methane-consuming bacteria to oxidize atmospheric methane. Their model indicated that atmospheric methane removal would be ineffective because the methane concentration is too low to enable cell survival. However, if concentrations were increased to 500–6000 ppmv CH4, similar to concentrations found near some landfills and concentrated animal feeding operations, 5 to 40 tons of methane could be mitigated per biofilter per year, depending on parameter assumptions in the model (Jackson et al., 2021, p. 8)

An important consideration for the feasibility of biochemical methods.

> Biocovers and biofilters containing methanotrophs are already used for methane mitigation from smaller or older landfills [48,65]. (Jackson et al., 2021, p. 8)

> no apriorireason why biotrickling filters couldn’t in principle be optimized for atmospheric removal more broadly. (Jackson et al., 2021, p. 8)

> iron-salt aerosols (ISA) as a methane removal method [47,66] (Jackson et al., 2021, p. 8)

> ISA approaches attempt to convert methane into CO2 in the lower troposphere by enhancing natural sinks of the hydroxyl radical °OH (responsible for 90% of the natural methane sink) and the chlorine atom Cl (3–4% of the natural methane sink) (Jackson et al., 2021, p. 8)

im not sure if this is a biochemical method? seems like geoengineering 

> iron, a micronutrient that can enhance ocean primary productivity (Jackson et al., 2021, p. 8)

could be biochemical if we argue that the iron increases the biomass of organisms that absorb methane... but not sure if that's the case.

> We do not yet know whether or which methane removal technologies will prove commercially feasible at scale; further research and development are required for all of the examples we presented. We also argue that a better understanding of the climate and air quality benefits of methane removal is needed to enable a more complete cost-benefit analysis of the potential for methane removal. The potential atmospheric and Earth-system consequences of large-scale methane removal have complex feedbacks that need better quantification. (Jackson et al., 2021, p. 9)

this would be good to mention in the conclusion or in a future outlook section

> Methane removal is a complement to, not a replacement for, mitigating methane and carbon dioxide emissions (Jackson et al., 2021, p. 10)

biochemistry in both methane removal AND mitigation?

> All negative-emission technologies, including those for methane removal, need to be examined through the lens of social considerations that could limit research and deployment. Social pressures contributed to legal restrictions on iron fertilization in the oceans and have curbed deployment of geological carbon storage projects in Germany and the Netherlands [106]. (Jackson et al., 2021, p. 11)

another important consideration for biochemical methods.  
  
although I guess if I'm just acting as an advisor to policymakers, I could just recommend the benefits of biochemical method and they can decide whether to change laws to allow for it haha

> If air handling is to be undertaken at large scales, it would make economic sense to convert other greenhouse gases simultaneously, particularly the catalytic reduction of N2OtoN2 [31]. Although our current paper emphasizes methane removal, co-removal of other gases would reduce unit costs (Jackson et al., 2021, p. 11)

Biochemistry -- microbes can have multiple enzymes at once for different GHGs? haha

> Negative emission technologies are expected to become a key tool for climate change mitigation in the second half of the century and may help keep mitigation costs fairly low [112,115]. (Jackson et al., 2021, p. 11)

Not exactly related to the essay but I think this is a good argument for me to do research in this space xD Can argue to astar lmao
