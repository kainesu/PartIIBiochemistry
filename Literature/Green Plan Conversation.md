# Questions

## Submitted

1. Why were certain years chosen as reference/baseline years for goal setting? E.g. Why 2005 chosen as the baseline year for the goal of greening 80% of all buildings?
2. Under the Green Economy pillar, it is mentioned that Singapore will aim to become a leading carbon trading and services hub and green finance centre. However, how will current financial investments in fossil fuel companies impact these measures? Are there any plans to regulate current and future investments in fossil fuels in the finance sector?
3. The Green Plan mentions that sustainable fuels will be promoted for international trade and travel. Will this promotion of sustainable fuels be backed by any laws or policies?
4. How will importing green energy and hydrogen affect electricity prices?
5. As Singapore cannot generate enough renewable energy on our own to meet our energy needs, will there be a longer term plan to completely change our reliance on fossil fuels over to green energy and hydrogen imports

## Additional questions

1. How does BCA 80-80-80 plan compare to international standards? 
2. How can we educate people to understand the trade-offs made between environmental sustainability and economic growth/SOL/etc?

- Intended to catalyze bold, balanced, and collective action
- Long-term and living plan — will evolve with national engagement, new technology, etc

**Our limitations**

- Limited land (land use is a trade-off between competing needs)
- Alternative energy disadvantaged
    - Do not have large plots of land for solar farms
    - No rivers, wind
- Solar energy is limited by land area, urban shade, intermittency
- No hinterland & natural resources - we must be plugged into global economy
- Need to invest in new solutions & infrastructure
    - Carbon capture utilization and storage
- Inclusive transition to green economy (!)
    - Upskill and reskill workforce

# Small group discussion

- Have we been prioritizing other land use needs too much?
- Green spaces have economic value too
    - Green spaces
    - Psychological value
- We need to plant the right type of trees for carbon capture, sequestration
- Building underground
- Should we set a national target for green spaces?
- Looking at green spaces outside of SG: how have we been affecting green spaces in other parts of the world? (e.g. impacts of SG companies on environment in neighbouring countries)
- can industry production bases be relocated overseas?
- Can solar panels, energy generation bases be relocated overseas to be imported?
- Government is working with banks to rein in companies to hold them accountable overseas
    - Must hold them accountable monetarily
- Too many shopping malls LOL
- Hard lanscape and soft landscape
- We can create pockets of industrial estates outside residential areas?
- Will the need for office space change in the future?
- EIA is old-fashioned?
    - Should include conservation factor (for biodiversity)
- Make developers pay for forest conservation
- Ornamental greenscaping
- insurance, finance industries must be engaged — CEOs, top management will listen to finance ppl bc they are the ones who control the $ flow
- Projects should have community consultation — should be done from early on and not just brought in to give the appearance of public engagement
- Doughnut economy
- Need to bring in media
- Media rhetoric focuses mostly on individual — but we also need to talk about the role of corporations, govt
    - Households only contribute 20% to emissions
    - Petrochemicals, transport contribute the most!

- Children can help educate and encourage adults

# Dialogue

Q: Greatest hurdle in devising SG green plan? What do we need to do so we are on track  to meet NDC targets? 

- Water, energy, food security
- Buy-in

Q: Waste management

Q: Working with industry

- Funding is important

Q: Can our 1m trees cover all our deforestation

- we should compare with other cities (not countries)
- We are land constrained
- A commitment to people that sg will remain green

Q: Carbon emissions metrics

- All scopes (including Scope 2 and 3) should be taken into account
- International rules will be followed in carbon counting
    - E.g. we include emissions from petrochemicals industry even though we don't ultimately consume all these petrochemicals/energy
- Yes we should aim to carbon neutral in the future
- Financing emissions?
    - Central bankers around the world are aware of risks of financing non-sustainable projects
        - E.g. if 20-30 years later, there is a complete ban on coal-powered plants —> investments in non-sustainable projects will be moot
        - E.g. carbon tax too high that commercially, it doesn't make sense
    - Banks and equity investors are also aware of these long-term risks
        - Glasgow financial alliance for net zero — initiative to bring 160 firms to 2050 net zero
        - Employees are also asking questions
        - Shareholders putting pressure

Q: How is SG coping with carbon emissions issue

- Carbon trading hub / carbon services hub
    - Not really a long term solution? ("shuffling deck chairs on the titanic")
    - ETS system should be expanded? — sufficient liquidity is needed
    - Not enough SG based REC for carbon offsetting even if users are willing to pay a high cost
- Carbon marketing
- Setting standards

# Other notes

- Have we been externalizing our carbon foot print?
    - Imported carbon is not included in our carbon footprint, but it should be

- Will the govt consider indirect emissions and financed carbon?
- "Carbon" gross domestic product?
- Prospering with 0 growth economics?
- According to Min Fu, the aim is to grow with lower carbon and resource use per capita
