# Emergence of robust growth laws from optimal regulation of ribosome synthesis

Project: TORC1 signalling

- macromolecular composition of Escherichia coli is correlated simply with the growth rate of the culture, largely independent of the specific nutrients in the growth medium
- Bacterial growth rate can be modulated through the composition of the growth medium (e.g. by varying quality of supplied nutrients)
- When the cell is growing, ribosomal protein fraction increases linearly with growth rate
- When traslation is inhibited by antibiotic, growth rate reduces accompanied by increase in ribosomal protein fraction (to compensate?)
- If ribosomal protein fraction is increased, less metabolic proteins are produced, and vice-versa
- For a given translational efficiency c and the nutritional efficiency m (as determined by the growth medium), the organism must choose the ribosomal protein fraction /R that balances the amino acid flux.
    - Amino acid pool size used as a sensor for flux mismatch – if amino acid pool size increases ⇒ supply > demand (”supply-driven activation”)
- Ribosomal proteins bind to rRNA, if there is no rRNA, they accumulate in the cytoplasm and bind to their own mRNA to suppress its translation
