> ==Model results indicate that assuming the global average atmospheric concentration of methane, 1.7 ppmv, methane removal is ineffective using these methanotrophic biofilters as the methane concentration is too low to enable cell survival==. If the concentration is increased to 500–6,000 ppmv, however, similar to that found above landfills and in concentrated animal feeding operations (factory farms), 4.98–35.7 tons of methane can be removed per biofilter per year assuming biotrickling filters of typical size (Yoon et al., 2009, p. 949)

Methane atmospheric concentration is definitely a problem for biological removal. Methane level control may be limited to areas where there is high levels of methane 

> cost of the equivalent ton of CO2 removal using these systems is $90–$910 ($2,070–$20,900 per ton of methane) (Yoon et al., 2009, p. 949)

Can't tell if this is considered expensive or not

## What is biofiltration? 

> Biofiltration is an engineered biological treatment process that utilizes the metabolic activity of microorganisms attached onto a variety of packing materials to treat a wide range of organic and inorganic contaminants (Yoon et al., 2009, p. 950)

> In a biofilter, contaminants in the gas phase diffuse into biofilms, a thin layer of a microbial consortium on the packing material, to be consumed by microorganisms therein. Biofilters are filled with a variety of packing materials to provide the surface area for establishment of biofilms (Yoon et al., 2009, p. 950)

## MMO is the enzyme involved in methane removal 

>The key, rate-limiting step in biotic methane removal is the transformation of methane to methanol by the methane monooxygenase or MMO. Two forms of the MMO exist, the membrane-associated or particulate methane monooxygenase (pMMO) and the cytoplasmic or soluble methane monooxygenase (sMMO) (Yoon et al., 2009, p. 950)

> pMMO is expressed in the presence of copper and that sMMO is only expressed in the strict absence of copper (Yoon et al., 2009, p. 950)

> pMMOexpressing cells are known to exhibit significantly higher affinities to methane than sMMO-expressing cells, as well as have higher reaction rates at lower methane concentrations, as implied by its lower half-saturation constant (Ks) and higher pseudo-first order-rate constant values (Yoon et al., 2009, p. 950)

So it is preferable to have pMMO-expressing cells.

> Methylosinus trichosporium OB3b (NCIMB 11131) expressing pMMO and sMMO (Yoon et al., 2009, p. 952)

## Results from simulation 

### Effect of methane concentration 
> methane removal using biotrickling filtration is not feasible if the global average atmospheric methane concentration, 1.7 ppmv, is assumed. This concentration is too low to support cell growth for either sMMO- or pMMO-expressing cells (Yoon et al., 2009, p. 953)

> above 500 ppmv both biofilm thickness and methane removal by pMMOexpressing cells achieved steady state within the first 2 months of operation, while sMMO-expressing cells achieved steady state at methane concentrations above 3,000 ppmv (Yoon et al., 2009, p. 953)

> if a methanotrophic biofilter expressing pMMO is placed in an environment with a local methane concentration of 500 ppmv, 498 kg of methane is removed per month after steady state is reached (Yoon et al., 2009, p. 953)

### Electricity cost 
> proposed biofiltration system requires electricity for three purposes: (1) to operate blowers, (2) to recycle nutrient medium, and (3) to maintain optimal temperature in the reactor. (Yoon et al., 2009, p. 953)

> total energy requirements vary from 227 to 712 MWh per year (Yoon et al., 2009, p. 953)

> Using an average cost of electricity of 6.16¢/kWh for industrial use (EIA 2007), total electricity costs due to heating will range from $14,000 to $44,000 per year per biofilter. (Yoon et al., 2009, p. 953)

> Our estimated costs of removal of an equivalent amount of CO2 as methane are approximately 2.5- to 25-fold higher (Yoon et al., 2009, p. 954)

might not be relevant anymore though since I would think that CO2 prices have increased since 2008

> it will be difficult to have net carbon removal if electricity is supplied by conventional fossil fuel power plants (Yoon et al., 2009, p. 954)

### Long-term usage 
> Biofilters and synthetic packing materials, in general, are known to have very long lifetime of at least 10 years (Yoon et al., 2009, p. 954)

good for long term usage!

> For the removal of methane, however, clogging is not a significant issue due to the low concentrations of the growth substrate, methane, even at the elevated concentrations assumed here (Yoon et al., 2009, p. 954)

> expected that the use of biofilters for atmospheric methane removal will require less maintenance due to clogging. (Yoon et al., 2009, p. 954)

## Could different microbes, enzymes be used? 

> More recently, high-affinity methanotrophs with very low half-saturation constants (40.5 to 134.5 ppmv) have been found to exist in some environments, e.g., organic agricultural soils, with such cells able to consume methane at concentrations as low as 1.7 ppmv (Yoon et al., 2009, p. 955)

> Their maximum capacity to degrade methane, however, was found to be very limited (Yoon et al., 2009, p. 955)

There are methanotrophs with higher affinity for methane, but they have very low half-saturation constants (by definition) -> take up less methane. 

==In future, could engineer better methanotrophic strains with low Km but high Vmax== – opportunity for biochemistry!  

> for Methylocystis strain LR1, less than 6 kg per month was estimated to be removed under optimal conditions (Yoon et al., 2009, p. 955)

> system failed to achieve steady state (Yoon et al., 2009, p. 955)
