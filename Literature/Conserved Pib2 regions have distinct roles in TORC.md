# Conserved Pib2 regions have distinct roles in TORC1 regulation at the vacuole

- Pib2 N-terminal regions → inhibitory role on TORC1
    - Shorter regions of conservation A-D
    - A and B → inhibitory effect
        - mutation of conserved residues in regions A, B highlight a series of **lysines** and **serines** involved in the inhibition
- Pib2 C-terminal regions, helical region E, tail → essential for TORC1 reactivation
    - 339VLR341 → AAA
- FYVE domain → required for vacuolar localisation (makes sense) but not for recovery from rapamycin exposure
- Predicted phosphorylation sites within Pib2 N-terminus that could affect function (nb: Pib2 phosphorylated by TORC1 downstream kinase Npr1)
