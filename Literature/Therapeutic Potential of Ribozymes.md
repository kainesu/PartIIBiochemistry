- SELEX (systematic evolution of ligands by exponential enrichment) can be used to select ribozymes for specific reaction conditions and catalytic activity
- Most prominent ribozymes: hammerhead, hairpin, hepatitis delta virus (HDV)
- For all 3 ribozymes, sequence specific cleavage occurs via a transesterification reaction
    - 2' OH group nucleophilic attacks adjacent phosphodiester bond
    - This forms a 2',3'-cylic phosphate and 5'-OH termini as cleave products
- Reverse reaction, i.e. ligation of cleavage fragments, has the same intermediate state
- Metal ions are important for ribozyme activity
    - HDV - divalent metal ions involved as cofactors
    - hammerhead, hairpin - metal ions not involved directly in catalysis, but are required for forming and stabilizing the a  active ribozyme structure and to neutralize negative charges
- availability of divalent cations, cell pH are important for ribozyme activity
    - But, all the small nucleolytic ribozymes have been shown to be active in vivo
- Unmodified RNA is susceptible to degradation by cellular ribonucleases. To overcome this, we could
    - Modify phosphodiester backbone e.g. use phosphorothioate linkages
    - Modify 2'OH group e.g. 2'-O-methyl, 2'-fluoro, 2'-O-methoxyethyl
    - Use of "locked nucleic acids" — 2'-O-4'-C-methylene linked bicyclic nucloeitdes
    - Use of L-RNA (instead of natural D-RNA)
- Chromatin silencing could affect endogenous ribozyme expression (if ribozyme gene is integrated into the chromosome)
