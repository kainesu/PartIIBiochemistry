> Much of the recent work has focused on partial oxidation of methane to species appropriate for liquid fuels, such as alcohols (Stolaroff et al., 2012, p. 6457)

## Mitigating methanogens 
> ==Electron accepting species (Fe3+,Mn4+,SO42−,NO3−) compete with methanogens for hydrogen and carbon substrates==. Thus, for example, ==gypsum (CaSO4·2H2O) addition== was found to reduce methane emissions in soils even in anaerobic conditions. (Stolaroff et al., 2012, p. 6457)

> ==Nutrient availability== also plays a role, e.g. potassium and phosphorus addition was found to favor methanotrophs in agricultural soils. (Stolaroff et al., 2012, p. 6457)

## Bioreactors 
> Because methanotrophs that metabolize methane at atmospheric concentrations (2 ppm) are common, ==a bioreactor could theoretically treat very low concentrations, however higher concentrations have been tested in practice as most systems are intended for landfill gas.== (Stolaroff et al., 2012, p. 6459)

> reactor based on MMO or a cultivated population of methanotrophs could be used to oxidize unconfined sources of methane. However, it ==would have to operate in a water body, liquid film, or moist solid substrate (as in soil particles)==. Such a scheme can be considered an open bioreactor. The ==challenge would be to achieve sufficient air exchange to oxidize a significant fraction of the available methane==. (Stolaroff et al., 2012, p. 6460)

## Biocovers 
> ==Biocovers== are the third approach to mitigating area sources. We use the term in a general sense, to refer to any permeable, biologically active layer which hosts methanotrophs to oxidize the methane passing through. (Stolaroff et al., 2012, p. 6459)

> For intermediate and permanent installations, a layer of soil is the simplest biocover. ==In a review of studies of cover soils for landfills, Chanton et al. found that 10−89% (mean 36%) of methane escaping from the underlying landfill is oxidized in the cover==, amounting to a mean of 72 g CH4/(m2·d). (Stolaroff et al., 2012, p. 6459)

> ==Engineered biocovers== work similarly, but make use of specially selected substrates to maximize methane oxidation. (Stolaroff et al., 2012, p. 6459)

## Mitigating methane emissions from rice fields 
> Mitigation strategies for rice fields, on the other hand, consist of ==manipulating the redox environment and the availability of organic carbon and nutrients to suppress methanogenesis==. For example, ==periodic drainage of the field==, which introduces oxygen and keeps the methanotroph population from taking hold, is widely effective. (Stolaroff et al., 2012, p. 6459)

understanding of methanotroph and methanogen biology -> solutions for reducing emissions

> ==use of ammonium sulfate ((NH4)2SO4) instead of urea ((NH2)2CO) as a fertilizer reduces emissions as does applying gypsum with urea instead of urea alone== (Stolaroff et al., 2012, p. 6459)

## Methane has short half life, so solutions need to be rapid enough to be significant 
> Because the chemical lifetime of atmospheric methane is about 10 years, any strategy which significantly reduces atmospheric methane concentrations would have to contact on the order of 1/10 of the atmosphere each year to compete with natural sinks (Stolaroff et al., 2012, p. 6460)

Otherwise, it doesn't make sense to add on artificial sinks

## MMO enzyme 
> ==Biotic systems, of course, do oxidize methane in ambient conditions== but using an aqueous-phase mechanism. The key ==hydroxylation of methane is achieved by the enzyme methane monooxygenase (MMO).== This reaction allows microbes to use methane both as a source of carbon and energy (Stolaroff et al., 2012, p. 6460)

> Research is ongoing into understanding the active site of this enzyme which would allow the ==building of synthetic mimics== for uses including engineered oxidation of methane for environmental applications.88 (Stolaroff et al., 2012, p. 6460)
