- As destruction of methane results in CO2 production, have to be careful that the CO2 emissions does not cancel out the global warming gain 
- Under certain circumstances, removal be as effective as preventing methane leaks (e.g. in areas with high methane concentrations)
- Locations where methane removal is feasible 
	- Landfills
	- Biodigesters 
	- Fossil fuel industry facilities 
	- Cattle

> Sixth Assessment Report of Working Group 1 of the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change advocated ‘Strong, rapid and sustained reductions in CH4 emissions’ (Nisbet-Jones et al., 2022, p. 2)

could put in intro

> justification for methane removal is the high GWP of atmospheric methane. Over 100 years, removing 1 g of methane is equivalent, including feedbacks, to removing 34 g of CO2; however, over 20 years, 1 g of methane is equivalent to 86 g of CO2 (Nisbet-Jones et al., 2022, p. 2)

also interesting to put in intro – to justify why we need to research methane removal 

> Will generating the energy needed to remove the methane induce so much released CO2 that the net long-term greenhouse impact is warming, not mitigation? Or, given there will likely be a limit to the funding available to ameliorate greenhouse gas emissions, will it be better to use these resources to reduce methane emissions rather than to remove alreadyemitted methane from the air? (Nisbet-Jones et al., 2022, p. 2)

Opportunity cost.  
  
Good to evaluate biological methods with these as well

## Chemical methods

> methane destruction by oxidizing it to CO2 reduces its 20-yr warming impact by 99%, or, if considered on a 100-yr warming impact timescale, by 97% (Nisbet-Jones et al., 2022, p. 3)

> Despite these possible advances **thermal-catalytic destruction** of methane in category 1–3 air is unlikely to be energetically viable, except in very unusual circumstances (Nisbet-Jones et al., 2022, p. 6)

> photocatalysis is relatively slow... Advances in materials science improving inexpensive oxide semiconductor photocatalysts [25] could have a very large impact here (Nisbet-Jones et al., 2022, p. 6)

## Biological methods

> In settings where methane concentrations are higher, as in termite mounds, aerobic methanotrophs can remove half the methane emissions [28]. (Nisbet-Jones et al., 2022, p. 7)

> Biofiltration of high concentration methane (% level) is a well-established technique [29] (Nisbet-Jones et al., 2022, p. 7)

> Soil methanotrophs are capable of removing ambient methane (greater than 2 ppm) [30]when natural meteorological fluctuations in air pressure pump air slowly through moist aerated soils, for example in upland forests (Nisbet-Jones et al., 2022, p. 7)

> However, uptake rates per m2 are very slow (Nisbet-Jones et al., 2022, p. 7)

> In these neglected landfills, adding more cover soils should be a simple but effective passive management technique of methane removal, providing host soil for methanotrophic uptake and also ==reducing smell and the risk of fires, which create local urban pollution== (Nisbet-Jones et al., 2022, p. 7)

positive externalities of methane removal from landfills

> there is much scope for research into effective strains of methanotrophs capable of efficient methane removal from lower concentration air, for example, using methanotrophic biotrickling filters (Nisbet-Jones et al., 2022, p. 7)

> There is, however, a **serious concern** that has received little attention—the **incidental manufacturing of other greenhouse gasses**. If nitrogen compounds are present in the ‘dirty’ air, for example, high ammonia concentrations in emissions from animal waste, the biofilter can **oxidize them to N2O, a gas with a long lifetime and GWP 300 times that of CO2. Bio-reactors can emit significant volumes of N2O**[34,35]. Melse et al.[35] showed that in one case over 20% of all ammonia present was converted to N2O and thus cautioned against recommending biofilter installations at livestock operations. This problem must be solved before biological methane destruction can be viable (Nisbet-Jones et al., 2022, p. 7)

> The addition of soil covers that have been seeded with highly efficient methanotrophs is also an extremely promising approach in regions where the capital outlay for piped gas collection and combustion is not affordable, for example in landfills around rapidly growing tropical cities. (Nisbet-Jones et al., 2022, p. 8)

an advantage of biological methods! 

> Biological treatment methods are already common in the pig farming industry [42] and can be adapted to methane removal if the issues around N2O generation can be resolved (Nisbet-Jones et al., 2022, p. 9)

> beef feedlots are major methane sources [17] and removal could mitigate manure emissions, though a better long-term option might be to rear only free-range grass-fed beef where the manure is rapidly dried in open pasture. (Nisbet-Jones et al., 2022, p. 9)

but not necessarily best for some sources? in the long term 

> To summarize: removal is feasible, but probably only justified in special circumstances where high-methane concentrations are habitually present. (Nisbet-Jones et al., 2022, p. 9)

> By contrast, **passive biological removal, for example by landfill cover soils, may be very widely justified**, especially in the Tropics and even more so if more effective strains of methanotrophs can be found. (Nisbet-Jones et al., 2022, p. 9)

> Stopping the emission of methane is preferable to removing it from the atmosphere (Nisbet-Jones et al., 2022, p. 9)

> Methane removal may increase N2O release (Nisbet-Jones et al., 2022, p. 9)

## three rules for evaluating methane removal processes 

> Removal must do no worse harm (Nisbet-Jones et al., 2022, p. 10)

> Removal must reduce net global warming (Nisbet-Jones et al., 2022, p. 10)

> Removal must be more cost-effective than reduction, at least in a local setting (Nisbet-Jones et al., 2022, p. 10)
