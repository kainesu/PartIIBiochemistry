They purified different isoforms of Pol II phosphorylated at particular CTD residues, and used quantitative, label-free MS to identify proteins that interact specifically with each type of Pol II

- Ser5P recruits spliceosome during transcription 
	- Ser5P interacts with U1 spliceosomal components 
	- ChIP-nexus of U1 subcomplex Mud1 and S5P found that Mud1 occupancy and S5P coincide exactly in a 200bp region just downstream of the 3' splice site of high U1 occupancy genes 
	- Loss of S5P also disrupts splicing 
		- Replaced S5 of first eight repeats in CTD with Ala
- Thr4 required for post-transcriptional completion of splicing 
	- Thr4P does not interact with spliceosome subunits 
	- ChIP-nexus of Thr4 showed that there is high levels of Thr4 after spliceosome dissociates
	- However, Thr4 does not cause the dissociation, but is a mark of spliceosome release 
		- U1 and U2 occupancy profiles not altered in Thr4Val mutant. 
	- Thr4Val replacement resulted in 90% of spliced genes having greater intron retention 
- Method 
	- Purify different phosphoisoforms of Pol II through sequential IP
		- Fuse Pol II to 3xFLAG tag and purify for FLAG tag to get all phosphoisoforms of RNAPII
		- Then purify for each phosphoisoform by targeting each phosphorylatable residue 
		- "Repetitive nature of the CTD permits the purification of factors that directly bind the targeted phospho-CTD residue even in the case that their association is displaced by the antibody interaction"
	- Samples from each IP analyzed by quantitative MS to determine which factors were enriched at each phospho-specific IP compared to the non-specific IP 
	- ChIP-nexus
