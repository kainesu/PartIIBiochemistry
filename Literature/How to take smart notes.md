# Zettelkasten workflow

1. Whenever you have an idea, make a **fleeting note**. 
2. Whenever you read a book, article, etc., make a **literature note**. 
    1. Write notes with a view of how they may be relevant to the notes you already have in your slip-box
    2. Write these in your own words. Do not lift from the text. 
    3. Include a bibliographic reference.
3. Put (1) and (2) into an inbox.
4. At the end of each day, go through your inbox notes and write **permanent notes**.
    1. Think about how the fleeting notes and literature notes relate to your own interests, research, thinking and **add links**
    2. Develop new ideas, arguments, discussions
        1. Combine ideas
        2. Support ideas
        3. Contradict ideas 
    3. Write as if you were writing it **into a paper**: full sentences, use references, etc. 
    4. The permanent note must be self-explanatory, including full context. 
    5. If you think of a new question while writing the permanent note, refer back to other notes in the slip-box. 
        1. If the answer is there, then link it in
        2. If the answer is not there, do more research, make new Lit notes, etc. 
5. Throw away the fleeting notes and file away the literature notes
6. Link the permanent note(s) to an index/entry note and related permanent note(s)
7. Add **1-3 keywords** (tags): "In which context do I want to stumble upon this note again?", "In what kind of paper would I need this information?" 
    1. Be selective with keywords. 
    2. E.g. a tag called "experiments" would be unhelpful because you wouldn't write a paper on *experiments*. 
8. Go through your slip-box regularly to find connections or contradictions. 

# How to read

## Principles

- Think beyond the context of the literature
- Read with questions in mind and relate the text to other approaches

## Workflow

1. Read through the book once, highlighting sections that seem interesting or useful. 
2. Re-read the book but only read the sections that you highlighted. Take notes on these sections and add them to your literature note. 

# Writing the paper

1. Read through your notes to identify gaps, questions
2. Do more research and add in more notes or revise your permanent notes
3. When there is enough, select notes most relevant to your paper, and turn them into a rough draft.
4. If there are still missing ideas in the argument, do more reading which adds to the slip-box. 
5. Edit and proofread.
