5.  Revisit the lecture notes when you want to complete the problems
6.  Complete the assigned problems.

## Revision

1.  Work on several problems of the same topic
2.  Take a break to enter diffuse mode

## When reading

-   After reading each page, look away for a minute to recall the main ideas you just read

# Using focused and diffused states

-   Focused mode helps us pay attention to problems requiring logic and analysis. This takes energy.
-   Diffused mode helps us be creative and learn new concepts
-   When you are feeling frustrated while working on a problem, it's time to shift to diffuse mode!

## Entering diffused mode

-   We enter diffused mode when we have cleared our mind of thoughts about the problem
-   Walk, nap, gym, listen to music, chores, shower, draw, play music you know well

# Approaching questions

-   Reflect and think on a problem before starting to solve it
-   When you reach a block, articulate what you need to know to solve the question
-   Always work on the problem yourself before asking for help
-   Practice a variety of problems at once, never many of the same type at once

# Making mistakes

-   Mistakes are inevitable
-   Start early to get past them!
-   Learn from mistakes.

# Learning new concepts

-   Anthropomorphize, personalize, bring life into concepts you learn to make them more concrete
-   Learn at your own pace, do not rush
-   Revisit new concepts regularly â€” don't ignore them for more than a day
-   When encountering new topics in lectures, rewrite your notes in the evening after the lecture
-   Always learn the big picture overview of a topic before starting on the details

# Creativity

-   Your first idea usually sucks. Don't just accept the first idea that comes to mind.
-   Expose yourself to many different ideas
-   Retaining concepts in your mind will allow you to form new connections between them

# Improving memory

-   Spaced repetition
-   Sleep
-   Create chunks
-   Practice active recall outside your usual place of study
-   Write by hand
-   Memory palaces

# Preventing procrastination

-   The anticipation of a task is always worse than the actual task
-   Make new habits by recognising cues, making new routines, and rewarding yourself for the new habit
-   Believe that you can overcome procrastination!
-   Compare where you are now to where you want to be to motivate yourself
-   Track your schedule in detail to find out why you procrastinate.
