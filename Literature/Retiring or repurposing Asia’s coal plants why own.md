# Methods for retiring coal plants

## Full or partial fuel conversion

- Use natural gas to co-fire in existing boilers
    - Major plant equipment e.g. boilers, steam turbines, heaters can be reused
    - Boilers, burners must be modifed
- The viability of converting coal plants to natural gas plants depends on strictness of emission standards, competitiveness of natural gas prices, availability of newer and more efficient natural gas turbine technology
- For fossil fuels, also need to invest in new LNG terminals or use existing terminals nearby or in-land as pipelines

## Retrofitting emissions control equipment

- Add emissions control equipment to existing coal-fired generation units to reduce emissions

## Decommission aged coal assets
