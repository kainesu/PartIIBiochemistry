- While the genetic code is universal, many species and particular cells may prefer certain codons over others for certain amino acids (**codon usage bias**)
- As such, it is important to use the codon that is used most frequently in that species and cell type to maximize translation efficiency i.e. **codon optimization**
- However, it is not always easy to identify the optimum codon for every amino acid
- Sometimes codon optimization is not desirable.
    - Some synonymous changes could affect protein conformation, folding and stability, change post-translational modification sites and even affect protein function
    - The rate of translation may be important to protein folding, so changing the rate can affect protein structure
    - It could remove information necessary for translation initiation and mRNA stability
    - Some synonymous mutations have actually been linked to disease
