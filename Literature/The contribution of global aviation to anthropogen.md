# How do aviation emissions affect the climate?

- Aviation emissions of $CO_2$ and non-$CO_2$ aviation effects results in changes to the climate system
- Both aviation CO2 and the sum of quantified non-CO2 contributions lead to surface warming
- Aviation contributes to global warming in several ways:
    - Plume dynamics
    - Chemical transformations
    - Microphysics
    - Radiation
    - Transport
- The important non-CO2 effects that have been quantified are from NOx emissions, water vapour, soot (from contrail formation)
- Contrail cirrus, NOx-driven changes in atmosphere chemical composition heat up the climate the most
    - NOx emissions lead to increased global ozone formation and decreased lifetime and abundance of methane → both positive (warming) and negative (cooling) RF contributions

Aviation processes that contribute to climate forcing from aviation

- In the future, airplanes are likely to continue using kerosene fossil fuel
    - Although renewable biofuels exist, there is not enough to offset fossil fuel use
- **What is RF**? = radiative forcing. Basically warming effect.
- Aviation emissions that have RF: contrail cirrus, CO2, NOx, H2O, sulfate aerosol, soot aerosol
- ERF is the preferred metric for comparing expected impacts of climate change contributors
    - There is a stronger correlation between ERF and changes in equilibrium global-mean surface temperature for forcing agents than for the corresponding RF

# Calculations of ERFs for different aviation emissions

- CO2: Combined kerosene and avgas usage
    - Global carbon-cycle
- NOx: Affects atmospheric abundances of O3, CH4, CO, reactive hydrogen (HOx)
    - "Other potential short-term effects from NOx emissions involve the
    direct formation of nitrate aerosol and indirect enhancement of sulfate
    aerosol", however there is a lot of uncertainty / unknown about these effect so they were not included in the model
- Water vapour emissions
    - Water vapour released in the stratosphere changes the humidity which changes the "radiative balance" of the water vapour
    - Water vapour RF is affected by the distribution of water vapour vertically and horizontally, seasonal changes in the height of the troposphere, and the short residence time of water vapour in the stratosphere
- Contrail cirrus
    - Contrail cirrus consists of linear contrails and cirrus cloudiness that result from the contrails
    - Planes increase cloudiness by forming contrails
    - Contrails form when the surrounding atmosphere has a lot of ice, so persistent contrails need lots of ice along the flight route
    - Contrails can be both cooling and warming. At night, they are only warming (⇒ flying at night is worse?)
    - Assessing the effect of contrails would need us to simulate how contrails interact with the atmosphere
- Aerosol-radiation interaction
    - Aircraft engines emit soot.
    - Soot is a mixture of BC, OC, and precursors for sulfate and nitrate aerosol
    - Most sulfur is emitted as SO2, while some is emitted as H2SO4
    - Soot absorbs short wave radiation → net warming
    - Sulfate aerosol scatters incomnig short-wave radiation from the Sun —> net cooling
- Aerosol-cloud interaction
    - Aerosols can affect how clouds form
    - E.g. cloud droplets and ice crystals can nucleate on aerosol particles
    - Sulfate aerosols mostly affect liquid clouds in the background atmosphere
        - Sulfate aerosols are good cores for nucleating around for liquid clouds → creates ice clouds
    - Sulfate aerosol-cloud interactions depend on how sensitive the cloud radiative field is to aerosols
    - Currently effect of aviation soot on background cloudiness is not really understood.
- Soot and sulfate particles are the main primary and secondary aerosol from planes

## Results

- Contrail cirrus formation has the largest warming term! But calculators do not focus on this.
- Followed by CO2 and NO2
- Non-CO2 terms account for 66% of aviation net ERF in 2018

# Emission equivalency metrics

See **Table 5!** 

- Use best estimate ERFs to calculate aviation-specific Global Warming Potential and Global Temperature change Potential
    - Assign CO2-emission equivalences to non-CO2 emissions via ratios of time integrated ERF and changes in future temperatures, respectively
- "Multiplier" = ratio of total CO2-equivalent emissions to CO2 emissions
    - This term indicates that aviation non-CO2 terms have additional climate impact than those from CO2 alone
    - The multiplier value depends on the choice of time horizon and emission metric
- Caveat to GWPs and GTPs – uncertainty of climate carbon cycles.
    - As the earth warms, carbon sinks absorb less CO2
    - When cycle feedback is accounted for, non-CO2 emissions metrics increase by a small amount
- Unlike conventional GWP, GTP metrics, the "multiplier" value will change significantly if future aviation emissions change from their projected growth trend ⇒ this is a potential issue for calculators!
    - The multiplier is assumed to be constant. But this is only true if the rate of change of non-CO2 RF is proportional to the rate of CO2 emissions
    - And since many non-CO2 emissions are short-lived, while CO2 is long-lived, aviation emissions need to rise exponentially for the non-CO2 RF to keep up with rate of CO2 emissions
    - nb: Calculator multipliers may not be up to date anymore

# Emission equivalency metrics

- Aviation non-CO2 forcings are not covered by the former Kyoto protocol (unlike direct emissions of GHGs from agricultural sector)
    - Are they covered by Paris, ICAO, or COP26?
- To halt aviation's contribution to global warming, we need to reach net-zero CO2 emissions AND declining non-CO2 radiative forcing
    - This is because CO2 is long-lived – just stopping non-CO2 emissions will only halt warming in the short-term
- Some studies have looked into incorporate non-CO2 forcings in climate policy by using an appropriate overall emissions "multiplier"
    - E.g. European Emissions Trading Scheme
    - However there has been too much scientific uncertainty to have such a multiplier
    - Also the multiplier depends a lot on how aviation emissions change in the future
- Other methods to reduce non-CO2 forcings – avoid contrail formation by re-routing aircraft, optimizing flight times (e.g. avoid night flights), changing cruise altitudes?
    - Could calculators incorporate such a level of sophisitication? Is it significant?
    - Each of these measures have issues. E.g. avoiding contrail formation through rerouting requires more fuel to be burnt → more CO2 emitted. So need to calculate if there is a net climat benefit or penalty over a defined period.
        - Whether the trade-of is "worth it" or not depends on the metric used and the time horizon.
        - E.g. reducing non-CO2 forcing while increasing CO2 emissions will reduce forcing in the short term, but increase it in the long term
- GWP vs GTP? GTP is an "end point metric" that captures temperature response. GWP has "artifical memory" over longer time horizons
