- Have a good background in the field 
- Make connections between things that might not ordinarily seem connected – but this is difficult, and "requires a certain daring", which requires learning widely to encounter diverse ideas 
- The connection at first usually seems unreasonable and only afterwards becomes reasonable 
- Such daring requires some level of self-assurance 
- May require some eccentricity in thought – an eccentric person? 
- New thoughts come in isolation, as the presence of others can make creation embarrassing, since for every new good idea you have, you will more likely have thousands of stupid ones 
- However, meeting other people may be helpful in swapping old ideas that you can then connect together to form a new idea 
- Such meetings must be *safe spaces* for people to express stupid ideas. People must be willing to say stupid things and also listen to stupid things. An air of informality would be best 
- Smaller groups are probably better (maybe 5)? Too many people → social tension. Too few people → not enough ideas 
- Great ideas often came as side issues 
- The meetings should be guided by someone who asks the right questions, makes comments, and guides people back to the point → facilitate creative process
