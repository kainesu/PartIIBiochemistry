**Abstract:** Directed evolution is a cyclic process that alternates between gene diversification and screening for or selection of functional gene variants.Library size limitations can be overcome by focusing library diversity on residues implicated by molecular structures, computational models or phylogenetic data. In cases in which there is limited information, random mutagenesis can be used to interrogate the uncertain determinants of protein function.Recombination methodologies access new combinations of functional variation and can shuffle disparate genetic elements to yield new chimeric proteins.Low-throughput screens can directly measure individual phenotypes and thus accurately isolate desired subpopulations. Screen throughput can be increased using indirect visible reporters that are strongly coupled to the desired phenotypes.Selections isolate functional variants through selective replication schemes or physical segregation. Selections operate simultaneously on entire populations and thus offer unparalleled throughput.
