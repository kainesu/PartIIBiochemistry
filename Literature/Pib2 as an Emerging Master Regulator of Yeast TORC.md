# Pib2 as an Emerging Master Regulator of Yeast TORC1

Note type: Source
Project: TORC1 signalling
Source type: Journal

- TORC1 is a complex containing TOR protein kinase, the catalytic subunit
- TORC1 is activated by pro-growth signals (e.g. nutrients, growth factors) and inhibited by anti-growth stresses
    - TORC1 responds to virtually any cellular stress → lacking a random protein can affect Torc1 activity
- TORC1 activates pro-growth cellular processes
    - Anabolic reactions – e.g. nucleotide/lipid/protein synthesis
- TORC1 inhibits catabolic reactions – e.g. autophagy

# Upstream regulators

- RAG GTPases (Gtr1/Gtr2 heterodimer in yeast, forms part of EGOC)
    - Activated by SEACIT for Gtr1 and Lst4-Lst7 by Gtr2
        - Immediate upstream regulators are highly conserved
        - In contrast, uppermost signaling components (i.e. amino acid sensors) have diverged
    - TORC1 regulation by Rag GTPases is bi-directional – upon nutrient starvation, Rag heterodimer inhibits Torc1
- Pib2
    - Glu and cys, but not other amino acids, activate TORC1 in a Pib2-dependent manner
    - Vacuoles alone contain all the essential machinery for Pib2-mediated TORC1 activation by glutamine and cysteine
    - Contributes to TORC1 activation by ammonium
    - Involved in regulation of TORC1-body formation by glucose
- Pib2 and EGO complex may work cooperatively

# Dual phase activation

- Following amino acid stimulation, TORC1 activation shows two distinct phases
    1. Acute and transient
    2. Slow and continuous
- Each phase has different amino acid selectivity
    - Phase 1 can be induced by any amino acid
    - Phase 2 induced by certain amino acids, particularly those that are “good-quality nitrogen sources” e.g. glutamine
- Speculation as to utility – phase 1 is “preparation stage” – switch on pro-growth genes in case there are rich nutrients. phase 2 only proceeds if there are indeed sufficient nutrients
- Torc1 is likely activated via distinct mechanims in Phase 1 and 2
    - Phase 1 → Pib2, EGO cooperative
    - Phase 2 → Pib2 and EGO redundant
