## Landfill emissions could be resolved using methanotropic bacteria 

### Landfill emissions is a more pressing issue in developing nations
> In some developed nations, particularly in Europe, landfill emissions are now heavily regulated. Worldwide, however, landfill regulation is weak, even in some jurisdictions with strong capabilities, such as parts of the United States. For example, Duren et al. (2019) found that landfills are the largest emitters of methane in California and dominate methane point‐source emissions in the state (41% of total). (Nisbet et al., 2020, p. 27)

> active mitigation of landfill emissions in developed nations is a long‐established and effective priority and thus not the focus of the discussion here. In contrast, in many tropical nations, landfill methane emissions are wholly uncontrolled and are characteristically high, especially in India (Nisbet et al., 2020, p. 27)

need for cheap solutions -- could be solved biologically

### Mitigation using bacteria by adding cover soil 
> Landfill emissions can be readily mitigated simply by adding a thicker soil cover to act as host habitat for consortia of methanotrophic bacteria. (Nisbet et al., 2020, p. 26)

> Landfill soil covers host active consortia of methanotrophic bacteria, and thus, bacterial methane oxidation is an attractive option for low cost methane mitigation (Scheutz et al., 2009). (Nisbet et al., 2020, p. 27)

Use of methanotrphs can be very effective, 

> In U.S. landfills with 0.3‐ to 1.2‐m thick soil covers, typically clay, Chanton et al. (2011) showed that a ==third or more of the egressing methane (37.5 ± 3.5%) is oxidized by methanotrophs== in these covers. (Nisbet et al., 2020, p. 27)

> ==Methanotrophic oxidation rates in moist but not waterlogged soil can be extremely high== (Whalen et al., 1990). (Nisbet et al., 2020, p. 27)

> ==Soil oxidation can be effectively enhanced by simple techniques, such as enrichment with biochar== (Reddy et al., 2014; Yargicoglu & Reddy, 2017). (Nisbet et al., 2020, p. 27)

> Scheutz et al. (2014) used a bioactive cover made of local compost materials such as garden and kitchen waste, and demonstrated an ==average mitigation efficiency of around 80%== (Nisbet et al., 2020, p. 27)

> Although methane oxidation is strongly temperature dependent (Wang et al., 2011), landfills are strongly exothermic. Einola et al. (2007) found that exothermic methane consumption continues in landfill cover soil even in cold meteorological conditions, a finding that may have ==value for mitigation in cool‐winter regions== such as north China, central Asia, and high‐altitude Bolivia and Peru. (Nisbet et al., 2020, p. 27)

Economically viable, and 

> possible that in some locations such as the Mediterranean it may be viable to use carbon credits to finance soil‐cover landfill mitigation directly (Kormi et al., 2018). (Nisbet et al., 2020, p. 27)

able to gain public support by providing other co-benefits. 

> Moreover, soil management of emissions also contains ==unwanted smell and fire risks== and is likely to gain local support (especially if the matured cover vegetation can then be given over to ==urban parks==). (Nisbet et al., 2020, p. 27)

## Agricultural emissions 

> Currently, many agricultural emissions of methane can be seen as too ==intractable== to consider for affordable mitigation (Nisbet et al., 2020, p. 33)

> ==Agricultural methane emissions are very large==, globally over 130 Tg/yr, with over 100 Tg/a from enteric fermentation and manure, around 30 Tg/a from rice cultivation, and in addition about 30 Tg/a from biomass burning, mostly deliberate (estimates from Saunois et al., 2016). (Nisbet et al., 2020, p. 34)

### Enteric methane emissions
> Methanogenic archaea are strictly anaerobic but find good habitats in the digestive systems of oxygen breathing land ruminants. Methane is breathed out from all foregut fermenters—cattle, sheep, goats, and deer. (Nisbet et al., 2020, p. 34)

### Methane emissions from manure 
> Moreover, it is not only the breath of animals that produce methane: If feces become anaerobic, then archaeal methanogenesis takes over. (Nisbet et al., 2020, p. 34)

> large manure tanks in industrial farming are major sources (Veltman et al., 2018). (Nisbet et al., 2020, p. 34)

### We need to pay attention to intractable emissions as well 
> ==Methane emissions from hard‐to‐mitigate sources, such as enteric fermentation, are very large (Rogelj et al., 2015; Reisinger & Clark, 2018), too important to ignore as intractable.== For example, high methane mole fractions, often 10‐100 ppm can occur in air around feed lots (Figure 19), cattle pens (Grainger et al., 2007), manure heaps, agricultural biodigesters (Flesch et al., 2011), and near active faces of landfills (Riddick et al., 2017; Zazzeri et al., 2015). Methane yield from manure is highly variable, depending on the diet fed to the cattle (Amon et al., 2007). (Nisbet et al., 2020, p. 34)

### Biological solutions to agricultural emissions 

> Although changes in cattle diet and management, such as open grazing on nitrogen‐managed pastures (Warner et al., 2015) rather than stall feeding, can be effective in cutting emissions, these approaches (not discussed further here, but accessible in veterinary journals) are often costly, only partly effective, or demand high skill levels by the farmer. They may be difficult to apply in nations such as South Sudan, with very high cattle population densities but low governance capacity. (Nisbet et al., 2020, p. 35)

#### Dealing with rice paddies: 
> Another interesting option is the use of ==biofertilizers== to enhance methanotrophy in fields (Singh & Strong, 2016). (Nisbet et al., 2020, p. 36)

#### Biofiltration challenges with low methane concentrations: 
> Girard et al. (2011) report ==effective use of biofiltration in removing up to 45% (and potentially up to 65%) of methane emitted from swine slurry in Canada, at mole fractions as low as 250 ppm== (Nisbet et al., 2020, p. 36)

> significant extra study will be required due to the ==extremely different conditions under which a low methane concentration biofilter will operate==, and there is a ==risk the biofilters may convert ammonia into nitrous oxide==, another powerful greenhouse gas (Melse & Hol, 2017). (Nisbet et al., 2020, p. 37)

> Yoon et al. (2009) modeled the behavior of trickling biofilters using standard methanotrophic bacteria and found that operation at ~500 ppm was possible. (Nisbet et al., 2020, p. 37)

> Potentially, extraction should be feasible even down to ambient air mole fractions if soil microbes that can consume ambient concentrations are used; however, ==rates may be slow and some cells probably cannot survive in a standard trickling biofilter== as the falling water shears cell walls and cell loss through shearing is greater than cell growth (Yoon et al., 2009). Passive airflow biofilters may offer a more favorable environment. (Nisbet et al., 2020, p. 37)

> one significant concern with using biofilters at low methane concentrations is that their operation may ==inadvertently increase other greenhouse gas emissions, in particular emissions of N2O== (Nisbet et al., 2020, p. 37)

> a review of bio‐filters in the swine industry has shown that ==biofilters increase the amount of N2O present of up to 400%== (Van der Heyden et al., 2015 (Nisbet et al., 2020, p. 37)

## Conclusion 
> ==If the Paris Agreement is to succeed, methane needs attention==. (Nisbet et al., 2020, p. 40)
