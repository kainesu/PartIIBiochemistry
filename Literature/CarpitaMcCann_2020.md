**Abstract:** <p>Lignocellulosic biomass—the lignin, cellulose, and hemicellulose that comprise major components of the plant cell well—is a sustainable resource that could be utilized in the United States to displace oil consumption from heavy vehicles, planes, and marine-going vessels and commodity chemicals. Biomass-derived sugars can also be supplied for microbial fermentative processing to fuels and chemicals or chemically deoxygenated to hydrocarbons. However, the economic value of biomass might be amplified by diversifying the range of target products that are synthesized in living plants. Genetic engineering of lignocellulosic biomass has previously focused on changing lignin content or composition to overcome recalcitrance, the intrinsic resistance of cell walls to deconstruction. New capabilities to remove lignin catalytically without denaturing the carbohydrate moiety have enabled the concept of the "lignin-first" biorefinery that includes high-value aromatic products. The structural complexity of plant cell-wall components also provides substrates for polymeric and functionalized target products, such as thermosets, thermoplastics, composites, cellulose nanocrystals, and nanofibers. With recent advances in the design of synthetic pathways, lignocellulosic biomass can be regarded as a substrate at various length scales for liquid hydrocarbon fuels, chemicals, and materials. In this review, we describe the architectures of plant cell walls and recent progress in overcoming recalcitrance and illustrate the potential for natural or engineered biomass to be used in the emerging bioeconomy.</p>
