## Sulphate reducing bacteria 
> methane oxidisers (primarily methanotrophs) and sulphate-reducing bacteria (SRBs) are the key microbial groups that degrade methane (Strong et al., 2017, p. 20)

> Sulphate-reducing bacteria reduce sulphate into sulphide using methane as an electron donor. The SRBs are reported to be syntrophically associated with anaerobic methane-oxidising bacteria/archaea, but none of these anaerobic microbes have been isolated and the syntrophic mechanisms are still unclear (Knittel and Boetius 2009) (Strong et al., 2017, p. 20)

## Classification of methanotrophs 
> Methanotrophs are now predominantly classified according to whether they are gammaproteobacteria or alphaproteobacteria; Type X is regarded as a subdivision of Type 1 gammaproteobacteria. (Strong et al., 2017, p. 20)

> Fig. 2.1 (Strong et al., 2017, p. 21)

good figure

## Use of methanotrophs in soil 
> More research is still required to better understand the complex relationship between methane-oxidising bacteria and other soil microbes, microbially enriched organic amendments, N source, N concentration, phosphate availability, C:N ratio, to enhance the methane sink within agricultural soils. (Strong et al., 2017, p. 24)

> Table 2.1 Amendments that improve soil and sediment fertility or decrease methane emissions. (Strong et al., 2017, p. 24)

## Biofilters for VAM treatment? 
> It is very difficult to adapt biofilters for VAM treatment unless the methanotrophs are robust and optimised to withstand fluctuating environmental conditions. Currently, the scale of the biofilters required to treat the large volume of VAM is not economically feasible. (Strong et al., 2017, p. 25)

> there are potential alternatives such as the use of alternative filter packing material and the use of immobilised biocatalysts (Strong et al., 2017, p. 25)

## Maturity of biocover technology 
> A number of full-scale biobased research projects are underway in USA, Germany, Denmark, Australia and Canada. (Strong et al., 2017, p. 28)

Biocovers have intermediate maturity as a technology

> The IPCC 2007 assessment report lists biocovers and biofilters as key mitigation technologies that are projected to be commercialised before 2030. (Strong et al., 2017, p. 28)

## Denitrification using methanotrophs 
> Methanotrophs can directly or indirectly participate in denitrification, especially in wastewater treatment systems (Strong et al., 2017, p. 29)

> Methane-dependent denitrification can be divided into two categories according to oxygen availability: aerobic methane oxidation coupled to denitrification (AME-D) or anaerobic methane oxidation coupled to denitrification (ANME-D) (Strong et al., 2017, p. 29)

> direct nitrate/nitrite reduction by aerobic methanotrophic bacteria (Strong et al., 2017, p. 29)

> Certain aerobic methanotrophs can produce substantial amounts of nitrous oxide when exposed to high nitrite concentrations (Strong et al., 2017, p. 29)

> second mechanism is indirect denitrification. Here, methanotrophs release soluble organic metabolites (methanol, formaldehyde, formate, acetate, etc.) that provide an electron donor for denitrifying bacteria (Modin et al. 2007). (Strong et al., 2017, p. 30)

> In wastewater treatment systems, nitrate/nitrite reduction is achieved by a consortium of aerobic methanotrophs and denitrifying bacteria. (Strong et al., 2017, p. 30)

> Nitrite-dependent anaerobic methane oxidation (n-damo) is a recently discovered process that couples anaerobic methane oxidation to nitrite reduction (Strong et al., 2017, p. 30)

> uses an intra-aerobic denitrification pathway and was performed by a new species with the proposed name: Methylomirabilis oxyfera (Ettwig et al. 2010) (Strong et al., 2017, p. 30)

## MMO enzymes have broad substrate range 
> Methanotrophs are useful bioremediation agents because of the broad substrate range of their MMO enzymes (Strong et al., 2017, p. 31)

but not good for methane removal...

> High concentrations of co-substrates can starve the methanotrophs of energy needed to survive (Strong et al., 2017, p. 33)

## Limitations of methanotroph usage 
> methane is required to maintain cell activity and large volumes of gas with low methane content can be difficult to treat effectively and cost efficiently. (Strong et al., 2017, p. 34)

> n agricultural sediments and soils, methanotrophs sequester methane, but are affected by fertiliser applications, while in wastewater treatment systems they can lower the costs associated providing an external carbon source to remove N. (Strong et al., 2017, p. 34)
