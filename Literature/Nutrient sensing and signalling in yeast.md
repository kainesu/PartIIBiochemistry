# Nutrient sensing and signalling in yeast

Note type: Source
Project: TORC1 signalling

Nutrient sensing proteins 

- Receptors
- Transporter-like sensors
- Transporter receptors in plasma membrane that sense presence of nutrients in extracellular medium
    
    
- TOR pathway is nitrogen sensing
- Ribosome content is tightly connected to the growth rate
- Nutrients are metabolised, and for many nutrient signalling pathways, at least partial metabolism of the nutrient is required
    - Sensing could be due to metabolites or metabolite-converting enzymes
        - Sensing through intracellular metbaolites is difficult to study – requires technical possibility of genetically modifying at single and multiple reactions in metabolic pathways and determining all relevant metabolci intermediates
        - Intefering with metabolism can cause many side effects and is often lethal for central metabolic pathways
    - Or a parallel system of extracellular and intracellular sensing

# TOR pathway

- TOR proteins sense intracellular N availability, particularly mobilisation of N reserves from the vacuole lysosome
- *S. cerevisiae* has two *TOR* genes instead of one (unlike most other eukaryotes)
- TORC1 consists of Tor1 or Tor2 associated with Kog1, Lst8, and Tco89
- Lysosome/vacuole limiting membrane is where TORC1 activation occurs
- TORC1 can respond to changes in intracellular amino acid availability determined by v-ATPase-dependent export of vacuolar amino acids to the cytosol
- TORC1 is regulated at the vacuolar membrane by EGOC (Ego1, Ego3, Gtr1, Gtr2)
    - Gtr1, Gtr2 are Ras-family GTPases
        - Gtr1^GTP/Gtr2^GDP stimulates TORC1 in response to amino acids
    - Ego1 tethers EGOC to vacuolar membrane as it is N-terminally myristoylated and palmitoylated
    - Ego3 function unclear
- Whether Gtr1/Gtr2 is bound to GTP/GDP is determined by the levels of each amino acid, and branched chain amino acids (e.g. leucine) have the strongest effect
    - Vam6/Vps39 is the GEF of Gtr1 ⇒ may be sensitive to AA levels
    - LeuRS – leucine binding to LeuRS may stimulate GEF-like activity towards Gtr1
    - SEACIT subcomplex (comprising Iml1-Npr2-Npr3) – Leu deprivation triggers Npr2- and Npr3-dependent, Iml1 GAP activity on Gtr1 → Gtr1 bound to GDP → heterodimer inactive → inhibit TORC1
- TORC1 exerts most of its control via AGC kinase Sch9 and Tap42-PPase complex
    - Through these two effectors, TORC1 modulates ribosome biogenesis and translation and inhibits stress incompatible with growth
- TOR pathway is a SPECIFIC nitrogen-sensing pathway, with a role in coordinating availability of extracellular nitrogen with intracellular nitrogen reserves → this impacts cellular growth (one of many outcomes)
