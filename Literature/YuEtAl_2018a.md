-  Investigated the ratio and sequence of Man and Glc and the arrangement of Gal residues in Arabidopsis mucilage mannan using enzyme sequential digestion, carbohydrate gel electrophoresis, and mass spectrometry
- CSLA2 is responsible for synthesis of the glucomannan backbone 
- MAGT1 catalyses addition of α-Gal 
- MAGT1 transfers α-Gal from UDP-Gal only to Man residues within the CSLA2 patterned glucomannan backbone acceptor 
- To investigate the fine structure of GGM, used enzymatic digestion + PACE 
	- Enzyme used – β-mannanase 26A (Man26A)
		- Specific to Man at -1 subsite but can tolerate Glc at +1 subsite and hence can cleave β-Man-(1,4)-β-Glc but not β-Glc-(1,4)-β-Man
		- Substitution of Man at -1 subsite by Gal or acetate is not tolerated 
- In vitro activity assays show that MAGT1 is highly specific, transferring α-Gal from UDP-Gal to Man of glucomannan oligosaccharides only when the acceptor has sufficient Glc-Man disccharide repeating units 
- In *magt1* mutants, CSLA2-synthesised GGM backbone was reduced
	- Gal substitution likely improves GGM solubility; without *magt1*, GGM may be more likely to precipitate, affecting backbone elongation 
	- *magt1* seed mucilage is very sticky, so poorly soluble glucomannan lacking gal may be lost during sample preparation 
	- Or, CSLA2 and MAGT1 may form a protein complex 
- This is similar to how CSLC and xyloglucan xylosyltransferase (XXT) interact
