# Questions for speakers

- Can high tech farms improve the sustainability of farming? e.g. use less resources to get the same output
- How to unlock alternative spaces for farming
- Is 30% enough to safeguard SG's food security in the long run, considering future pressures from climate change?
- Should we look at reducing food waste as a way to reduce our reliance on overseas food supply?
- How do we decide where to source from and what considerations should we have?

# Experts

- Paul Teng — agrotech scientist
- Bjorn Low
- Evelyn Eng
- Faridah Saad — Enterprise SG

# Notes

- We rely on institutions too much for food security (e.g. the government)
- Food sovereignty movement?
- Food injustice
- Agrarian urbanism – adding farming to urban planning situations
- We should all be concerned about food security
- What is food security? BAU access, affordability, high standards of food
- Are we food *resilient*? Food supply chain
- Can local farms achieve price parity with imports?
    - Cannot compete with our regional neighbours who offer a much lower rate – farms offer "luxury" produce
- Affordability is an important component of food security
- Food security = all people, at all times have access to safe and *nutritious* food — see FAO definition
- On average, households spend 10% of income on food (which is lower than our neighbouring countries)
- How to incentivize people to pay the premium for local produce? All surveys show that SG consumers are very price sensitive, especially heartlanders
- People need to be educated about the food they are consuming and its impact on the environment
- SMU study on food poverty in SG – accessibility is there, but the choice
    - Low income families tend to choose high carbohydrate, processed food (e.g. instant noodles) instead of fresh food
- GAIN global alliance for improving nutrition
- There are at least 100k families in SG who regularly fall below food security line
- Global food price index has been going up for the past 6 months
- One of the symptoms of affordability is substituting high nutrition food for low nutrition food so they can buy more food
- Singaporeans should be changing expectations of food cost, especially those who can afford it
- Closure of Jurong fishery port
- We should focus on perennial greens and herbs
    - Such plants can withstand changes in weather e.g. due to climate change
    - pest resilience
- Seed availability is an issue
- Food forests — efficient way of growing
    - Make use of vertical, horizontal, underground space
    - Thrive in wet climates
- Soil farming and food forests are actually a resilient way of farming – do we need high tech?
- Seed producing nations have been keeping seeds for their own stocks and exporting less to other countries due to the current global uncertainty in the pandemic
- Many farms operate on a high input high output model. Should we look at a low input high output model? Also food waste issue
- Inputs to farming are costly. If we do not address this issue we will continue to have this weakness in the supply chain
- Should SG be stockpiling seeds for future catastrophes? Our ability to produce seeds is doubtful
- Logistics, processors in the supply chain
    - We overrely on such components in our food supply chain
- Each component in the food supply chain must be resilient for SG to achieve food resilience
- Quite a number of MNC input enterprises are in Singapore (e.g. Cargill). So why are we not resilient? Bc manufacturing and production takes place elsewhere. What we've anchored in SG is only the R&D
- How to help farms run a viable business model? Commercial resiliency
    - How to get vegetables to the consumers?
    - People do not know how to prepare perennial greens?
- Cultural resiliency — people know how to prepare a diverse range of crops
- With perennials, we can save labours costs in replanting
- Regen economy
- Heritage plants
- Biodiverse food system
- Native plants as part of our food system?
- How can local foods be made more appealing to Singaporeans?
- Singapore has to address food security *elsewhere* to secure the remaining 70% of our nutrition
- Household resilience – encouraging Singaporeans to grow potted vegetables
- Staples
    - It doesn't make sense for SG to grow rice, although it's technically possible
- In the 70s, govt did not prioritize agriculture industry because it was a low value industry. food was (is?) underpriced
- Global food security index
- Rice bowl index
- If we want to secure food imports, we have to secure our relationships with other countries (relationship capital), or enter legal agreeements that bind trade partners to continue exporting food to us
- We cannot use vertical farming for certain crops because they are just grown so efficiently elsewhere – SG cannot compete
- Self sufficiency need not always mean security
    - Concentration risk
- What is the optimal mix of the three strategies employed by the govt? Each has a trade-off (local production, import diversification, stockpiling)
- Water efficiency
- Food forests can be a "bank" for heritage plants, perennial plants
- Spectrum from soil based to environmentally controlled, high-tech agriculture
- Govt is not prescriptive in technology and approach – individual enterprises are free to decide on the "how". EnterpriseSG wants to enable these enterprises to access what they need e.g. infrastructure, debt financing, scaling up, distribution, overseas export
- Most Govt grants look for local shareholding
- SFA Agriculture Cluster Transformation (ACT) fund
- sustainability criteria for grants?
- Eureka network: local sg enterprises collaborate with EU enterprises
- sg-israel collaborations on innovation
- If we really want high self sufficiency, then we need a high level of subsidization — see EU and US level of subsidy for agriculture
- Soil based farms are important to landscape, not just for agriculture. In situ conservation, provides ecological services, educating urban residents about farming
- But needs to be balanced with controlled environment agriculture – one buffer against climate change
- Developing genetically superior seeds in Singapore? A lot of research is focused on western crops (e.g. corn) and not so much asian crops (e.g. Chinese greens) – domininating part of the supply chain
- SG needs to be realistic about how much food we can produce ourselves. Mixture of low tech, high tech farming that is supplemented with more use of unused space
- Selling produce from community gardens at farmers' markets. in SG cannot sell produce without license from SFA, which is different from other countries
- In the future, what if there isn't even enough food to buy? What if we have to compete with bigger players like China, India?
- More seed banks in SG?
- SFA our food future consultation
- URA public engagement
