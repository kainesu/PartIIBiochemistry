**Abstract:** The hallmarks of cancer comprise six biological capabilities acquired during the multistep development of human tumors. The hallmarks constitute an organizing principle for rationalizing the complexities of neoplastic disease. They include sustaining proliferative signaling, evading growth suppressors, resisting cell death, enabling replicative immortality, inducing angiogenesis, and activating invasion and metastasis. Underlying these hallmarks are genome instability, which generates the genetic diversity that expedites their acquisition, and inflammation, which fosters multiple hallmark functions. Conceptual progress in the last decade has added two emerging hallmarks of potential generality to this list—reprogramming of energy metabolism and evading immune destruction. In addition to cancer cells, tumors exhibit another dimension of complexity: they contain a repertoire of recruited, ostensibly normal cells that contribute to the acquisition of hallmark traits by creating the “tumor microenvironment.” Recognition of the widespread applicability of these concepts will increasingly affect the development of new means to treat human cancer.

# Hallmarks
## Sustaining proliferative signalling 
- Normal tissues control production of growth signals, cell cycle progression 
- Cancer cells have deregulated proliferative signals, often transmitted from RTKs 

### Mechanisms 
- Produce growth factors themselves (autocrine signalling)
- Stimulate normal cells in tumour microenvironment to produce growth factors 
- Overexpress receptors that bind growth factors 
	- e.g. EGFR 
- Constitutive activation of components of signalling pathways downstream of receptors 
	- Mutations in MAPK pathway e.g. BRAF 
	- Mutations in PI3K pathway e.g. Akt 
	- Loss of negative feedback 
		- Ras mutations prevent GTPase activity 
		- Loss of function in PTEN phosphatase (e.g. by promoter methylation) -> cannot degrade PIP3, product of PI3K -> amplify PI3K signalling 
		- mTOR inhibition -> increased activity of PI3K -> Akt/Pkb 
	- Avoidance of senescence and apoptosis 
		- Modulate intensity of oncogenic signalling to drive proliferation while avoiding activation of intrinsic tumour suppression 
		- Disable senescence, apoptosis pathways 

### Challenges 
- Many growth signals are transmitted in a temporal and spatially regulated way from neighbouring cells, but such paracrine signals are difficult to test 

## Evading growth suppressors 
- Cancer cells need to attenuate signalling from tumour suppressor pathways that limit cell growth and proliferation 

### Mechanisms 
- p53 largely transduces intracellular inputs on various stresses
- pRB regulates cell cycle progression and largely transduces signals from outside the cell 
- Contact inhibition 
	- E.g. Merlin (product of *NF2* gene) induces contact inhibition by coupling cell-surface adhesion molecules (e.g. E-cadherin) to RTKs (e.g. EGF receptor). This strengthens adhesivity of cadherin-mediated cell-cell attachments 
	- E.g. LKB1 organises epithelial polarity, and can also counter Myc signalling 
- TGF-β signalling
