- Review covers the biological options for converting methane into a product or using it for something other than electricity or heat generation. If methane can be used to create high value products, then methane oxidation by methanotrophs may become more economically viable. 
- Genetic engineering of methanotrophs may result in the production of new products and with increased yield, efficiency

## Effect of ammonia on methane oxidation 
> Ammonia affects different methanotrophs to differing extents and can be a competitive inhibitor of methane monooxygenase or toxic when in the intermediate forms of hydroxylamine and nitrite.23 However, ammonium acts more as a nutrient than an inhibitor in the presence of sufficient methane (Strong et al., 2015, p. 4003)

## Heterologous expression of MMOs
> Besides the cost associated with the enzyme cofactor/ reducing equivalent, it is also difficult to heterologously produce MMOs.84 MMO genes have been cloned into bacterial expression systems (which could enable faster and greater enzyme production), because of the relatively slow growth rate of methanotrophs. However, MMOs are complex proteins (consisting of a reductase, hydroxylase, and regulatory protein), and a heterologous expression system has proved elusive. Complete, active MMOs have not been produced thus far, only a partially active sMMO with a functional hydroxylase.22 Active pMMO85 or sMMO86 can be obtained directly from methanotrophic cultures. Although the pMMO is commonly inactive when stringently purified from native bacteria (as it is removed from its lipid matrix and the closely associated proteins and cofactors), active MMO can be purified from methanotrophic biomass (Strong et al., 2015, p. 4007)

## Wastewater denitrification and methanotrophs 
> Biological wastewater denitrification systems require organic carbon to facilitate the reduction of nitrate to nitrogen. (Strong et al., 2015, p. 4009)

> However, modern wastewater treatment plants frequently need to supplement their systems with a costly external carbon source such as ethanol to achieve more stringent discharge limits (Strong et al., 2015, p. 4009)

> Using methane as a low-cost carbon source to facilitate denitrification would be highly beneficial (Strong et al., 2015, p. 4009)

> Methane is used by the methanotrophs, and they in turn provide an electron donor (such as acetate) for the denitrifying bacteria. (Strong et al., 2015, p. 4009)

## Limitations for methanotrophs 
> The greatest technical challenge for gas fermentation at scale remains the efficient mass transfer of poorly soluble gaseous substrates into the aqueous phase (Strong et al., 2015, p. 4011)

## Areas for future research 
> Genetic engineering and synthetic biology have a large role in the future application of methanotrophs and their enzymes, as indicated by the strong emphasis on these techniques in many of the ARPA-E funded projects. Some projects involve completely synthetic enzymes for methane activation (Arzeda Corp.), while others will re-engineer enzymes for methylation (Northwestern University, Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory), pathways (University of California Davis), or methanotrophs (University of California Los Angeles) (Strong et al., 2015, p. 4012)

> new metabolic pathways are also being engineered into methylotrophs to convert methanol into butanol (University of Delaware) (Strong et al., 2015, p. 4012)
