# Technologies for understanding biological systems

**Map molecules, wiring, connections:** Expansion microscopy

- Increasing resolution
- Light microscopes can be used for nano imaging
- Can be used for proteins and RNA
- In-situ genome sequencing —> spatial transcriptomics
- Iterative expansion microscopy — approaching electron microscopy resolution?
- [http://expansionmicroscopy.org/](http://expansionmicroscopy.org/) Democratizing nano-imaging
- Uses off the shelf products
- Cannot be done on living things

**Control high speed dynamics: Optogenetics**

- Microbial opsins
- Luck - without modification, were fast, effective, safe to mediate neural control

**Observe high speed dynamics**: Tools for fluorescent imaging of dynamics

- Directed evolution screen
    - Was the gene or genes responsible for the biosensor identified?

# notes

- think backwards from the problem
- survey all fields of science and engineering to build the tool to solve the problem
- simulate a thought on a computer and have it understandable to humans?
- positionally moving neurons with expansional microscopy?
- getting cells to follow a laser to move them
- no objective way to measure consciousness
    - Well technically our brain can measure consciousness hmm...
- How do we define a thought? (qualia?)
- Experiments streaming directly into computations online
- in-situ proteomics?
- try to be lucky - optimize your knowledge, trying random things, collaborating
    - can we make serendipity deliberate?
- learn the fundamentals: chemistry, physics, computer science. biology is built on top of these fields so it's important to know the underlying fields
- think about if you're happy with your work
