> However, his estimate that it would require an “energy bill that is three orders of magnitude larger for a ton of methane” (compared with 220 MJ per ton of CO2) seems premature, absent more specific engineering designs for CH4 conversion or capture (Jackson et al., 2020, p. 358)

If biochemical solutions can reduce the energy cost of capturing and converting methane, this could be the niche it provides in the landscape of solutions (I want to say "meta" but seems too gamery haha)

> passive systems, as championed by Lackner1, do have some benefits over more energy-intensive systems with blowers. (Jackson et al., 2020, p. 358)

> methane can be used directly as a fuel or chemical building block if it is captured (Jackson et al., 2020, p. 358)

> few viable large-scale processes that use CO2 as a feedstock at present (Jackson et al., 2020, p. 358)

> Engineering demands may conspire to make CH4 removal costs prohibitive (Jackson et al., 2020, p. 358)

> Mitigation of a greenhouse gas is almost always better than removing it after its release into the atmosphere (Jackson et al., 2020, p. 358)

so biochemical mitigation at source?

> However, not all CH4 mitigation efforts are technologically or economically tractable. We envision ‘permanent’, ongoing CH4 removal to offset the most intransigent and expensive emissions from the energy sector and, more likely, food production—including emissions from ruminants and rice farming. In fact, it may be impossible to eliminate global CH4 emissions this century and hence stabilize the atmosphere without continued CH4 removal, even when atmospheric restoration is achieved (Jackson et al., 2020, p. 358)

food production!! could be good place for biochemistry to intervene

> any source of methane that results in higher-than-background concentrations in air would lower the energy requirement and cost of methane removal (Jackson et al., 2020, p. 358)

economics would likely apply to biochemistry too.

> Modest CH4 mitigation from geologic seeps and fires seems more practical than mitigating larger and more diffuse wetland and freshwater sources (Jackson et al., 2020, p. 358)

dont think biochemical solutions can prevent methane emissions at source in this case but could contribute to removal from atmosphere after it is emitted.

> research in the neglected field of negative emissions for methane, nitrous oxide and other gases beyond CO2 alone. (Jackson et al., 2020, p. 359)

Could be worth mentioning under "future prospects"
