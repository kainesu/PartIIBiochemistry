# Aims

## **City in Nature**

- 200 ha more land for nature parks (from video) — all households to be within 10 minutes of a park
    - CoS 2021: "Develop over 130ha of new parks" and "enhance 170ha of existing parks with more vegetation and natural landscapes"
- 1 million more trees  which will sequester 78k tonnes of CO2
- Work with communities and NGOs to develop programmes to allow people and wildlife to live in harmony
- Strengthen connectivity between green spaces

## Energy reset

**Towns**

- 15% less energy in HDB towns by 2030 e.g. through smart LED lights and solar energy
- Green 80% of all buildings (by Gross Floor Area) by 2030, 80% of new buildings (by GFA) to be SLE buildings by 2030, best-in-class green buildings to see 80% improvement in energy efficiency by 2030 (compared to 2005)
    - Note: Is there a particular reason why certain years are chosen as reference dates e.g. start of implementation of Green Mark Scheme?
- Eco-friendly districts e.g. jurong lake district

**Transport**

- Expand rail network by 360km by early 2030s
- 8 in 10 households to be within 10 minute walk of train station by 2030
- New town concepts e.g. tengah - first car free town centre
- Expand cycling network by 1320km by 2030
- Implement pedestrianisation where possible
- Raise share of trips taken on public transport use to 75% by 2030
- by 2040 have all vehicles run on cleaner energy — phase out international combustion engine vehicles
    - All newly registered cars to be cleaner energy models from 2030
    - New registrations of diesel cars and taxis to cease from 2025 (CoS 2021)
    - Increased EV charging points to 60k by 2030, including 40k in public carparks and 20k in private premises (CoS 2021)
    - 8 EV ready towns with chargers at all HDB carparks by 2025 (CoS 2021)
    - Revise vehicle tax structure

**International transport**

- Aviation - 2% improvement in fuel efficiency every year
- Carbon neutral growth from 2020
- Reduce emissions from international shipping by 50% by 2050 (compared to 2008 levels)
- Promote sustainable fuels for international trade and travel

(I couldn't find this on the website, but it was mentioned in the video...?) 

**Energy** 

- We don't have land for solar, wind farms
- Quadruple solar energy deployment by 2025 e.g. covering rooftops of HDBs with solar panels
- 5x solar energy by 2030 (compared to today)
- Tap green energy from ASEAN region — electricity & hydrogen imports
- Halve energy required for desalinated water through R&D (by when?)
- All local waterworks will be powered by solar
- Increase solar deployment to 1.5 GWp by 2025, at least 2 GWp by 2030
- Increase efficiency of gas-fired power plants to reduce emissions e.g. by adopting more efficient gas turbines

## Green economy

**Green economy**

- Carbon tax will be used to invest in helping enterprises reduce greenhouse gas emissions
- Enterprise Sustainability Programme - help enterprises esp SMEs be more sustainable
- Leading carbon trading and services hub
    - Create new jobs in green finance, sustainability consultancy, verification, credits trading and risk management
- Green finance centre
    - Green Finance Action Plan
- RIE 2025
    - Decarbonization technologies
    - Low-carbon hydrogen
    - Energy efficient materials
    - Circular economy solutions
- Jurong island to be sustainable energy and chemicals park
- Sentosa to be a carbon neutral destination by 2030
- Green and Sustainability Low Loan Grant (?)

## Resilient future

- New coastline defences
- Moderate rise in urban heat by increasing greenery and piloting use of cool paint on building facades
- Increasing greenery
- Increase local food production to make local food supply more resilient
- 30 by 30 — 30% of nutritional needs by 2030 produced locally

## Sustainable living

**Sustainable development**

- Aim: Zero waste nation with high rate of recycling in circular economy — circularity in waste materials
- Turn incinerated waste into NEWsand
- Build up recycling capabilities
- By 2030 reduce waste to landfill by 30% , 20% reduction by 2026
- Phase out refrigeration and air-conditioning equipment that use high global warming potential (GWP) refrigerants from 4th quarter 2022

**Education**

- Eco stewardship programme from primary to pre-u levels
- 2/3 reduction of net carbon emissions from schools sector by 2030
- At least 20% of schools to be carbon neutral by 2030
- Science centre
- Strengthen curriculum and school programmes on sustainability
    - How?
