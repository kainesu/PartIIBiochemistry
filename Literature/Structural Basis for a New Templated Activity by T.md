- TdT actually has templated-polymerase activity, similar to pol μ, in the presence of higher concentrations of a downstream DNA duplex with a 3' protruding end, and performs a micro-homology single base-pair search to align the DNA synapsis
    - When tested with a 1:1 (TdT/DNA downstream duplex) ratio the
    elongation activity of TdT is still completely untemplated, as
    observed previously
        - How to calculate TdT/DNA downstream duplex ratio?
    - At higher ratios, with a 20-fold excess of downstream duplex, we observed a template-dependent activity of TdT, which is gradually lost below a ratio of 10
    - = Template-dependent activity of TdT is concentration dependent
    - When pol μ was placed with a protein/DNA ratio of 1:1, it gave similar results to TdT
- However, it lies at the extremity of a spectrum of more and more template independent DNA pol in the polX family from pol β < λ < μ < TdT
- TdT can acquire templated activity via a single mutation in the SD1 region
    - This mutation destabilizes Loop1
    - Loop1 is responsible for steric exclusion of the normal template strand (=Stable Loop1 is important for template-independent activity? Maybe switching between stable ↔ unstable Loop1 also triggers switch between template-dependent and template-independent activity)
- Pol μ can acquire higher untemplated activity via a single point mutation or using Mn2+ or Mg2+ (can using Mn2+ for TdT also increase its template-independent activity?)
- Loop1 interacts with DNA quadruplex (see Figure 3)
- Two specific DNA interactions in the A5/T5GC complex can be observed with residues D396 and H400 (Loop1) that form direct hydrogen bonds with the 50-OH of the upstream template strand
- 5' phosphate binding site and the sequence of Loop1 are important for template-dependent polymerase activity using an in trans substrate
    - The 5' phosphate binding site of pol μ has a positive charge that is absent (R175) in the equivalent residue of TdT (S187) — positive charge interacts with negatively-charged 5'P
    - Mutating D179A may also increase selectivity — D is a nearby negative charge that disfavors binding to 5' phosphate
