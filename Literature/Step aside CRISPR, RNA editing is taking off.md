# Why edit RNA

- Cas9 can trigger immune responses or create accidental changes to genome that would be permanent
- RNA editing creates temporary fixes to eliminate mutations in proteins, halt production, or change their funvtion
    - Any errors would be eliminated as cells degrade unused RNA
- Useful for diseases without genetic origin
- Regulate gene expression e.g. Nav1.7 — essential proteins should not be knocked out completely, but RNA editing can regulate expression
- Mimic genetic variants that provide a health advantage e.g. *PCSK9*
- Fight tumours - use RNA editors to turn off key signalling molecules
- Less likely to be immunogenic than Cas — ADARs are human proteins while Cas is bacterial

# Why RNA editing occurs in nature

- Defence against viruses?
- Regulatory function?
- Protect double stranded RNAs from immune attack?
- Role in embryonic development
- Function in select tissue of adult organisms e.g. cephalopod nervous system

# RNA editors

- ADAR (Adenosine deaminases): acts on dsRNA to deaminate adenosine to inosine which is read as guanosine (so effectively A→G)
- APOBEC1: changes C to U in dsRNA
- Linking ADAR to Cas13
- Pseudouridylation — RNA enzymes chemically modify uridine structure
    - Does not change sequence of mRNA or protein, but stabilizes RNA molecule and prevents mRNA from being translated

# Limitations

- Ways in which RNA sequences can be edited
- Getting RNA editing to work in vivo
- ADARs are less efficient than CRISPR
- Changing gene expression could affect other parts (pleiotropy?)
