# TLDR

- We can determine the origin of an object by identifying the microbes present on the object
- The combination of microbes found on an object is location-specific
- Suggested solution — introduce synthetic, non viable microbial spores in certain places of interest (e.g. food production areas) which would be taken on by objects produced in the area
    - Care must be taken to ensure that microbes can be grown at industrial scale, the spores do not have adverse ecological effects, can persist in the environment, and will label objects that pass through it
    - The microbes also have to be easily and accurately identified (sequenced)
- Object provenance can be traced by barcoding the spores
    - Synthesize DNA barcodes, insert barcodes into spores, inoculate spores into the environment.
- Spores used are from *Bacillus subti*t*l*e*s* and *Saccharomyces cerevisiae*
- Barcodes are identified using SHERLOCK, qPCR, sequencing, etc.
- Spores designed not to affect native environment
    - Use of autotrophic, germination-deficient strains
