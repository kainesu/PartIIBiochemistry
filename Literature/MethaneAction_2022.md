>Methanotrophic bacteria also breaks down methane in the biosphere.

>With or without methane removal, methane would oxidize into water vapor and CO2. The main difference between natural methane oxidation and methane removal is time:  methane removal enhances methane oxidation and speeds up the natural process, so atmospheric methane levels fall faster

>methane doesn’t necessarily need to be captured, since it can be oxidized freely using catalysts.

Is this necessarily true...? 

>There are a [broad range](https://royalsocietypublishing.org/doi/10.1098/rsta.2020.0454) of methane removal technologies under development.  They include photocatalysts, catalysts associated with zeolites and porous polymer networks, biological methane removal such as biotrickling filters and soil management approaches, and iron salt aerosol methods or catalysts enhancing natural methane sinks which accelerate atmospheric oxidation of methane.

> Methane removal technologies... needs further research on cost, technological efficiency, scaling and energy requirements, co-benefits, and impacts

I think these are good factors to keep in mind when considering the feasibility of biochemical solutions.

Article also claims that CO<sub>2</sub> and methane levels are linked; but how? Why is it that when CO2 emissions rise, methane emissions do as well? And when methane emissions rise, CO2 emissions rise as well?
