**Abstract:** Single-molecule approaches for studying the dynamic properties of motor proteins have come of age. Recent technical developments allow us to see more details of molecular motions and of the forces that molecules generate.Atomic force microscopy provides the highest available resolution, of about one nanometre, for imaging soft and dynamic motor proteins in action. Recently, significant progress has been made in imaging fragile samples and in high-speed imaging, with rates of up to 25 frames per second being achieved; for example, it is possible to image kinesin motors on top of microtubules with low forces while still being able to resolve single domains of the motor proteins.Fluorescence microscopy is unbeaten in achieving molecular specificity of imaging. Progress has been rapid, especially in single-molecule fluorescence methods. Detectors, which are mostly charged coupled device cameras, are constantly getting more efficient and less noisy. Methods for restricting the sample volume to suppress background noise are becoming increasingly sophisticated. Last, but not least, chemical fluorophores, genetically encoded fluorescent proteins and fluorescent nanoparticles are becoming more versatile, bright and stable.Single-molecule fluorescence experiments in cells remain challenging. Crowding and background fluorescence are difficult to avoid. High hopes are resting on newly developed bright and stable dyes, as well as on fluorescent nanoparticles, especially in the near-infrared spectral range, where cellular background fluorescence is minimal.Optical trapping has been firmly established as a tool of choice when measuring steps or power strokes of motor proteins as well as forces generated by single motors. Optical trapping is being implemented in increasingly sophisticated and powerful ways. The resolution of sub-nanometre steps is possible, time resolution can be as good as microseconds, and controlled forces of piconewtons can be exerted on single molecules in well-controlled geometries.It remains a challenge to apply optical tweezers in cells. Specificity of trapping, as opposed to indiscriminate trapping of various intracellular objects, is hard to achieve, and it is difficult to calibrate force and displacement measurements in cells. Promising developments include the trapping of distinct high-index cellular components, such as lipid droplets, and the use of externally introduced high-index particles, such as gold nanobeads, as well as the exploration of resonantly enhanced trapping.

# What are molecular motors? 
- Machines that convert free energy (obtained mostly from ATP hydrolysis) into mechanical work 
- E.g. myosin, kinesin, dynein 
	- Catalytic domain – nucleotide binding region + Actin or microtubule binding site 
	- Neck region 
	- Tail domain – contains alpha-helical section 
	- Cargo-binding domain
- Many motors can dimerise via tails or stalks 
- ATPase cycle – motor nucleotide hydrolysis and release of hydrolysis products are coupled to small movements in catalytic domain 
	- Small movements are amplified by mechanical elements connected to catalytic domain, particularly the neck linker in kinesins and alpha-helical lever-arm in myosins 
- During power stroke, lever arm of myosins rotates around its base at catalytic domain; in kinesins, neck linker docks to the catalytic domain.

# Why single molecule techniques
- Critical for studying **dynamics**! 
- EM is a static technique. 
- Can be used to determine basic parameters of chemomechanical energy transductions of motors e.g. step size, forces

# Atomic force microscopy
- Nanometer resolution structural information on domain conformations 

## Principle 
- Imaging mode: a mechanical lever arm ("cantilever") with sharp tip samples height profile of an immobilised biomolecule 
	- Forces on cantilever can be measured by its deflection 
		- Resolution – tens of piconewtons 
	- #experimental_evidence AFM video recording of an entire unlabelled motor protein for myosin V motor moving along actin filament 
	- #experimental_evidence Image inactive kinesins (given non-hydrolysable ATP analog AMP-PNP) bound to microtubules
- Force spectroscopy: Molecule of interest positioned with one end fixed to surface and other end attached to cantilever, so tension can be applied to the molecule by moving cantilever 
	- Has been used to study unfolding and refolding of proteins 
	- #experimental_evidence Used to study unfolding kinetics of kinesin neck coiled-coil; AFM experiments showed that neck linker forms a very stable coiled-coil, ensuring efficient force transmission between heads

## Disadvantages
- Sample has to be fixed to a surface, so cannot image within cell 

# Single molecule fluorescence microscopy
- To localise single molecules, need to collect more photons from molecule than from background
- This can be done by restricting sample volume, and working with pico- to nanomolar concentrations of fluorescent molecules
- Fluorescent probes have to be attached to the molecule of interest
	- Synthetic fluorophores
	- Fluorescent semiconductor nanoparticles ("quantum dots")
	- Recombinant fluorescent fusion proteins 

## Total internal reflection fluorescence 
- Concentrates illumination light to thin layer near surface. 
- Single fluorophores attached to motors moving along surface-attached microtubules are thus selectively excited while fluorophores in the background are not excited (being further away)
- #experimental_evidence Used to image hand-over-hand processive stepping of a single myosin V and kinesin-1 molecules 
	- IF two different dyes or quantum dots are attached to each head of myosin V, heads can be colocalised with nanometre accuracy 
- Photobleaching can be exploited to accurately localise single fluorophores
	- #experimental_evidence Sequential bleaching allowed for distances of ~10nm between single fluorophores attached to heads of myosin VI to b resolved

- For data analysis, common to use **kymographs**, a "graphical representation of movement along one axis over time, assembled by laterally adjoining linear slices out of consecutive video frames."

# Single molecule FRET 
- Can be used to resolve distances 
	- #experimental_evidence Used to detect distances of <10 nm between a donor dye (Cy3) and acceptor dye (Cy5) attached to two heads of Kinesin-1. Both heads found to bind to microtubules at saturating ATP concentrations; at lower concentrations, motor attached via 1 head. 

## Advantages
- Can localise single motor molecules and quantify movement *in vitro* and in cells 
	- However, tracking motors in live cells can be challenging due to high background noise and the fact that motors move rapidly in three dimensions (instead of two that can be imposed in vitro)
- FRET can be used to measure conformational changes of sub-domains at nanometre spatial scale and millisecond temporal resolution 

## Disadvantages
- Fluorophores eventually become photobleached, which limits the time over which they can be followed 

# Optical tweezers 
- To measure displacement and forces generated by single motor proteins 

## Principle
- Optical tweezers use a laser beam to exert piconewton forces and can be used to measure forces, displacements of trapped microscopic probe particles ("beads"). Movement, force on beads used as a proxy for movement, force of molecule. ![[Pasted image 20230528210408.png|500]]
- **Measuring force.** #experimental_evidence Used to measure power-stroke of myosin II in a "three-bead assay" – two beads are held by tweezers and used to suspend an actin filament, while a third bead is attached to the myosin motor. ![[Pasted image 20230528210328.png]]
- **Measuring displacement.** Done with force clamps. #experimental_evidence Force clamp experiment used to test whether one or both kinesin-1 heads bind to microtubule in between steps. 
- Temporal resolution is in the millisecond range.
