## Enzymes involved in methane oxidation to methanol 
>For the ==conversion of CH4 to methanol, two forms of methane monooxygenase have been found==. One form, the ==membrane-associated or particulate methane monooxygenase== (pMMO) is found in most known methanotrophs and is located in the cytoplasmic membrane. Another form, the ==soluble methane monooxygenase (sMMO)== is found in some methanotrophs and is located in the cytoplasm. ==In methanotrophs that have both forms of MMO, copper (Cu) is known to be a key factor in regulating the expression of the genes encoding both sMMO and pMMO as well as the activity== of these enzymes (Semrau et al., 2010, p. 496)

### sMMO 
> sMMO is a well characterized, three component enzyme consisting of a hydroxylase, a reductase, and a regulatory protein (Semrau et al., 2010, p. 497)

> 54 000 Da polypeptide of the hydroxylase contains an oxygen-bridged diiron cluster as the site of CH4 catalysis (Semrau et al., 2010, p. 497)

### pMMO
> little is known about the molecular properties of the pMMO (Semrau et al., 2010, p. 497)

## Biofilters and biocovers 
> Biocovers involve the application of permeable material, typically organic matter (e.g. compost, sewage sludge, wood chips) over the surface of a landfill. Such materials can have effective gas transport (of both CH4 from the underlying refuse and oxygen from the atmosphere) while also having adequate water retention to stimulate methanotrophic activity (Semrau et al., 2010, p. 507)

> Biofilters also attempt to stimulate methanotrophic activity, but are contained fixed bed reactors with biofilms established on some packing material (Semrau et al., 2010, p. 507)

## Methanotroph activity at low methane concentrations 
> It has also been found that methanotrophs also remove significant amounts of CH4 from the atmosphere, i.e., at concentrations on the order of 1.7 p.p.m.v., (Semrau et al., 2010, p. 508)

> Molecular analyses indicated that ==Type II methanotrophs== as determined by the labeling of 18 carbon fatty acids upon provision of o 50 p.p.m.v. 14C-CH4 ==were responsible for the observed CH4 consumption== (Semrau et al., 2010, p. 508)

> two Methylocystis strains (Knief & Dunfield, 2005). These strains, although unable to grow at atmospheric CH4 concentrations, were found to oxidize CH4 at this level for 3 months (Semrau et al., 2010, p. 508)

> ==a third Methylocystis strain was found able to grow at 10 p.p.m.v. CH4==, and that this cell had two isozymes of pMMO that had significantly different kinetics and expression patterns (Semrau et al., 2010, p. 508)

> ==pMMO2 isozyme could oxidize CH4 at atmospheric concentrations== (Semrau et al., 2010, p. 508)

> methanotrophs oxidizing CH4 at atmospheric concentrations in acidic forest soils were expressing pMMO (Kolb et al., 2005). (Semrau et al., 2010, p. 508)

> ==pMMO-expressing cells are responsible for atmospheric CH4 consumption==, and it may be possible to utilize their activity for mitigation of global anthropogenic CH4 emissions. (Semrau et al., 2010, p. 508)
