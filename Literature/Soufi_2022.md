- Cellular identity – how do stem cells differentiate, and how can differentiated cells be reprogrammed into stem cells 
- Reprogramming is difficult, so need to better understand the mechanism of reprogramming to improve the process 
	- Inefficient 
	- Lengthy and unpredictable
	- Reprogramming factors are highly oncogenic 
	- Unfaithful – often introduce other genetic, epigenetic modifications
- Chromatin effects -> Not accessible to transcription factors 
- Some reprogramming TFs may act as pioneer transcription factors e.g. Oct4 
	- Targets closed chromatin early in development, so called "pioneer" since they bind first 
	- Have a unique ability to interact with DNA in heterochromatin, allowing them to bind first 
	- Most other TFs have to compete, and are cooperative 
	- Nucleosome binding is separate from DNA binding – mediated by different structures (via deletion analysis)
- ATAC-Seq to show that Oct4 can access closed chromatin 
- And stable nucleosome binding over time is important to get the sites to open up, and maintain the accessibility of pluripotency enhancers 
- Deletion analysis of Oct4 to determine which regions important for reprogramming 
- Make Oct4 more specific by only using domains of Oct4 that mediate reprogramming? 
- Cellular identity is defined by specific TF combinations 
- TF co-binding shifts laterally from early to fully reprogrammed cells
