- Use Anki to remember facts related to important projects e.g. key information from papers you read
    - Core claims, questions, and ideas of the paper
- Syntopic reading to get an understanding of the field – read the best 5-10 papers in the field in depth, then do shallow reads of more less important papers to understand what routine progress in the field looks like
- From syntopic reading, identify open problems, questions you’d like answered, interesting observations, blind spots
- Anki can be useful to learning things about a new field
- Make most Anki questions and answers as **atomic** as possible
    - Break down questions into atomic questions, but retain the original question as well as a form of integration
