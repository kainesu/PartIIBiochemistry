# Resonances

Outline:

-   review of harmonic-oscillator physics
-   resonances and quantum myths
-   resonances in galactic dynamics: non-linearity
-   stellar waves in galaxies
-   resonance, chaos, armageddon

# Collapse of wavefunction

-   When we measure psi, we often think it "collapses" instantly from $E_j$ to $E_k$
-   In fact, the transition from $E_j$ to $E_k$ takes many cycles
-   E.g. Lyman alpha transition takes 10 million cycles (and this is one of the fastest atomic tranistions!)

# Photoelectric effect

-   When we expose a metal surface to monochromatic light, at frequencies below critical frequency $ω_0$, nothing happens no matter how bright light; but at frequencies above $ω_0$, electrons are ejected no matter how faint the light
-   Ejection rate is proportional to the intensity of the light

# Resonances and galactic dynamics

-   Stars are 3D oscillators (they oscillate in three planes) –
    -   They go around the galactic centre at frequency Ω,
    -   Oscillate in and out at frequency κ,
    -   And oscillate above/below the galactic plane at frequency ν
-   In a Kepler potential, these three frequencies coincide
-   In a galaxy, these three frequencies are different
-   Moreover, these amplitudes of oscillation are often not small; the frequency decreases as amplitude increases

## Barred galaxies

-   Lindblad resonance
-   Linear theory predicts radical oscillations diverge as ILR and OLR are approached
-   Star orbits become trapped by resonances
-   Trapped orbits synchronise radial oscillations with the bar angle
-   Torus mapping

# Armageddon

-   Ephemerides
-   Laskar & Gastineaux
    -   In 1% of trajectories, Mercury's e becomes large enough to collide with another planet
    -   In 1 solution Jupiter goes rogue
    -   Arises due to resonance between Mercury and Jupiter
