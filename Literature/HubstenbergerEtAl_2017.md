**Abstract:** Within cells, soluble RNPs can switch states to coassemble and condense into liquid or solid bodies. Although these phase transitions have been reconstituted in vitro, for endogenous bodies the diversity of the components, the specificity of the interaction networks, and the function of the coassemblies remain to be characterized. Here, by developing a **fluorescence-activated particle sorting (FAPS) method to purify cytosolic processing bodies (P-bodies) from human epithelial cells**, we identified hundreds of proteins and thousands of mRNAs that structure a dense network of interactions, **separating P-body from non-P-body RNPs**. **mRNAs segregating into P-bodies are translationally repressed, but not decayed**, and this repression explains part of the poor genome-wide correlation between RNA and protein abundance. **P-bodies condense thousands of mRNAs that strikingly encode regulatory processes**. Thus, we uncovered how P-bodies, by condensing and segregating repressed mRNAs, provide a physical substrate for the coordinated regulation of posttranscriptional mRNA regulons.

my summary: 
Hubstenberger et al (2017) proposed a model where proteins bind specific ZIP code elements in mRNAs to target them to P bodies, where they are translationally repressed due to the presence of mRNA regulatory proteins and an absence of translation machinery. **mRNAs that encode proteins with regulatory functions are stored in P bodies**, from which they can be rapidly mobilised for translation, while constitutively translated mRNAs that are excluded from P bodies encode housekeeping functions
