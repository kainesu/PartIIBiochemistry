# Unsolved mysteries of Rag GTPase signaling in yeast

Project: TORC1 signalling

- TORC1 = target of rapamycin complex 1
- TORC1 is a kinase and a master growth controller that integrates different inputs (including amino acid levels) and affects different outputs (e.g. protein translation, macroautophagy)
- The level of amino acids affect TORC1 activity, but it is unknown how the level of amino acids mechanistically affects TORC1 activity
- Rag family of GTPases may be involved – these assemble into heterodimers of RagA/B with RagC/D, or yeast Gtr1 and Gtr2
- Rag forms part of the lysosomal/vacuolar membrane-associated mamalian Rag-Ragulator or the yeast EGO complexes, and as part of these complexes, they relay amino acid signals to TORC1
    - GTP-bound RagA/B/Gtr1 and GDP-bound RagC/D/Gtr2 are TORC1-stimulating
- In higher eukaryotes, Rag GTPases recruit TORC1 from the cytoplasm to the lysosomal membrane to enable its activation by Rheb
- In budding yeast, however, TORC1 is constitutively present at the vacuolar membrane as well as in perivacuolar foci and remains detectable at these sites even in the absence of amino acids (e.g., leucine) or nitrogen
    - In yeast, EGO-TC acts as a scaffold to tether Rag GTPases to the vacuolar membrane
    - EGOC = Gtr1, Gtr2, Ego1, Ego2, Ego3
- Vam6 and/or additional associated proteins mediate GEF activity
- Within EGOC, Gtr1 and Gtr2 assemble into heterodimers
    - Gtr1^GTP/Gtr2^GDP → TORC1
    - Gtr1^GDP/Gtr2^GTP -| TORC1
    - GTP loading status of Gtr2 likely impacts on the capacity of Gtr1 to hydrolyse GTP
- Other proteins that interact with EGOC
    - Ltv1 – via interaction with Gtr1.
    - Ivy1
    - Ego4 – levels of Eg4 are low in exponentially growing cells and strongly increase when cells transit through the diauxic shift → nutritional conditions may shape the composition and structure of EGOC (not currently known yet)
        - Ego4 is a paralog of Ego2
- EGOC localises to the membrane via N-terminal lipid modification of Ego1 (carried out by myristoyl-CoA:protein *N*-myristoyltransferase Nmt1 and palmitoyltransferases Akr1 and Pfa3)
    - Is the modification of Ego1 and targeting to the membrane also subject to nutrient regulation?
- How do Rag GTPases interact with TORC1 in yeast?
    - Direct activation of TORC1?
    - Required for local structural adjustments of TORC1?
        - GTP hydrolysis may cause G-domain arrangements within the Gtr1-Gtr2 heterodimer → exposes a binding surface in the heterodimer for TORC1 subunit Kog1
            - Active Gtr1/Gtr2 bind to TORC1 via Kog1 in yeast but not inactive
- Inactive Rag GTPase module has also been reported to negatively affect growth, which could be rescued by loss of the TORC1 subunit Tco89
- Glucose starvation triggers TORC1 disassembly and movement of Kog1 to a single body on the edge of the vacuole
    - This is due to AMp kinase/Snf1-dependent phosphorylation of Kog1 in the prion-like domain
- How do amino acids control different GAP complexes that affect Gtr1 and Gtr2?
