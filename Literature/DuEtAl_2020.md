 - Specifically, the lipid environment affects the orientation of AcrZ on AcrB; "Conformational shifts were detected between detergent-based crystal structures and the saposin disc-reconstituted cryo EM structure for both AcrB and AcrBZ (including) a previously unseen, significant bending of AcrZ towards the binding groove in AcrB... (which) could be caused by the presence of lipids in the saposin disc mediating new contacts with AcrB or...exerting a force on AcrZ" 
- Determined that changing the concentration of cardiolipin in the nanoparticle resulted in conformational changes in AcrB, changes in chloramphenicol sensitivity 
- Overall data suggests that "interaction of AcrZ and AcrB increases affinity of the complex for cardiolipin- and POPG-enriched environments inside the inner membrane", and "cardiolipin and other lipids, together with AcrZ, modulate the activity of AcrB by inducing structural alterations in the drug entry and binding sites", with "cardiolipin and AcrZ... encourag(ing) a more discrete binding mode for chloramphenicol in the AcrB distal pocket"
