Engineered *Coprinus cinereus* heme peroxidase to have higher thermal stability, oxidative stability, such that it has more persistence in activity under laundry conditions than wt peroxidase. 

# Background
- Peroxidase catalyses the oxidation of coloured dyes to a colourless product in the presence of H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub>.

# Methodology & Results
1. Site-directed mutagenesis 
   - M166F, M242I, Y272F -> remove oxidisable residues around active site heme group -> improved oxidative stability 
   - E239K -> remove destabilising ionic repulsion with E214 -> improved thermostability 
   - Combining mutations to create M166F, M242I, Y272F, E239K improved both thermostability and oxidative stability 

2. Directed evolution R1 (error-prone PCR)
- Entire wt gene mutagenised with error prone PCR and cloned into yeast expression system 
- Screen for **residual activity** 
- Screening produced two mutants that both had substitutions at E239 (previously identified in SDM)
- Also chose V53 mutation for further SSM as V53 mutants had higher initial activity than wt without improvement in stability

3. Site-specific randomisation / site-saturated mutagenesis 
- SSM at E239 -> replacement with non-charged, non-bulky residues improved thermal stability, with E239G having the best overall performance in terms of both initial and residual activity 
- SSM at V53, M166, E214 did not identify substitutions that improved stability 
	- E214 may be structurally important in other ways apart from ionic interaction with E239 – perhaps hydrogen bonding to S202, Q210 found in Ca<sup>2+</sup> binding site

4. Directed evolution R2 (error-prone PCR)
- Directed evolution on mutant 072, which contains the best mutations identified from SDM and R1, i.e. E239G, M242I, Y272F
	- M166F excluded as it reduced alkaline stability 
- Produced library from 072 using error prone PCR, and screened for residual activity with more stringent H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> conditions (1m,at pH 10.5 and T=50°C) 
- Mutants that survived the screening found to have much higher residual activity, suggesting higher stability, but higher stability mutants found to have reduced initial activity 

5. DNA shuffling R1
- Intent is to separate mutations beneficial to stability from those deleterious to enzyme activity 
- Selected wt gene and 10 mutants representing a spectrum between low activity/high stability and high activity/low stability for shuffling 
- Genes amplified via PCR to add homologous regions to the 3' and 5' ends -> allow for homologous recombination 
- DNA shuffling between these 11 sequences produced a library that was screened for high level activity *and* residual activity (at 50°C, 2mM H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub>)
	- This identified mutants 972 and 974 which had both higher initial activity and residual activity than input mutants 
	- Both mutants had same sense mutations – I49T, V53A, E239G, M242I, Y272F

6. DNA shuffling R2 
- Use an input pool of 28 mutants (including 972 and 974, 10 sequenced mutants, 16 unsequenced mutants from DE R2) to create an even larger library of ~30k mutants from DNA shuffling
- Screening stringency was further increased to pH 10.5, 50°C, 5 mM H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub>, 20 min. Only residual activity was screened. 
- Produced 3 mutants with improved residual activity with same sense mutations of I49S/T, V53A, T121A, M166F, E239G, M242I, and Y272F
	- These mutants retained 49% of activity at even more stringent conditions (15mM H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> )
- I49S/T, V53A, M166F combination contributed most to stability of final mutants, but did not previously occur together. 

7. Characterisation of purified mutants 
- Final mutants expressed in *A. oryzae*, purified, and characterised in a thermostability assay, peroxide stability test, dye bleaching test, time course experiment under laundry conditions 
- All outperform wt in terms of specific activity under laundry conditions 

## Screening 
- Initial POXU
- % residual activity: Determined after 20min incubation at 50°C in pH 10.5 buffer, 0.2mM H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub>
- Thermostability: % activity remaining after treatment for 5min at 40°C 
- Oxidative stability: Enzyme half-life at 40°C in pH 10.5 buffer, 0.2mM H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub>
- Alkaline stability: pH 7 and pH 10 specific activity, determined at 30°C using model dye as a substrate
