# TLDR

- In the GAL pathway in yeast, the decision to activate the pathway is independent from the control of expression level
    - So there is an “on switch” and a dimmer switch
    - Decision is measured by fraction of cells that have expressed genes
- This behavior is created through hierarchical regulation of a single transcription factor
    - Gal4p is required to turn on the Gal pathway. Gal80p sequesters Gal4p, and Gal3p sequesters Gal80p. When concentration of active Gal3p exceeeds total Gal80p concentration, Gal4p is released and Gal pathway sharply switched from off to on state.
    - Total amount of Gal4p controls amount of transcriptional output from GAL1 (part of GAL pathway). Glucose controls Mig1p activity which controls amount of GAl4p. Hence glucose controls level of GAL1p.
- Dimmer switch regulation allows cells to fine tune their responses to the environment
- GAL response was measured in different combinations of glucose and galactose concentrations using GAL1pr-YFP — galactose:glucose ratio determines whether pathway is turned ON
- When most cells were activated (ON switch is activated), the mean expression level then depended only on glucose concentration (dimmer switch)
- Switch and dimmer controlled by separate genetic elements
