- Used a detergent-free membrane mimetic to perform cryo EM on isolated AcrB, i.e. nanoparticle 
- While detergents can extract membrane proteins from cells, they also remove protein-associated lipid molecules when they disrupt the membranes 
- Using a detergent-free membrane mimetic is important to functional integrity of AcrB 
	- In AcrB D407A, the lipid bilayer "buttresses protein interactions lost in crystal structures after detergent solubilisation"
