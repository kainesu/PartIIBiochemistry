# TLDR (abstract)

- Screened many transformants of *Chalmydomonas reinhardtii* to inestigate how different parameters affect transgene expression (specifically GFP expression)
- Tested 9 different terminator elements from three different size classes
- Optimal terminator size reflects the median size of terminators in *C. reinhardtii*
- Termintors had similar behaviour between different promoters, strains, and transgenes.
- Expanded the set of terminators that can be used for stable and high transgene expression

# Questions

- Use of chloroplast — “naturally accumulates high levels of soluble protein”. More than other parts of the cell?
- Not sure why transgenes are inserted randomly? is it because of low specificity of the specific recombination technique?
- Why choose to study terminators (instead of other genetic elements that could affect transgene expression e.g. enhancers, splice sites?)
