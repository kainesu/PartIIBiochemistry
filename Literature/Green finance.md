**International**

- Green bonds
- Green loans
- Sustainability-linked loans
    - Gren loans are for environmental stuff, sustainability-linked can also be for social stuff ("social sustainability")
    - But currently most sustainability-linked loans are environmental-linked
    - Green loans have certain critera to fulfil. Sustainability-linked loans – as long as it's related to sustainability somehow its considered as linked, but its not legally binding. So the party doesn't have to fulfil the sustainability stuff they promise to do
        - Whether sustainability-linked loan legally binding depends on two parties
    - Loans usually issued by banks
    - Green loans are strict in terms of criteria, sustainability-linked loans are more lax
    

**Singapore/informally used**

- ESG funds – environment (economic) social governance
    - Used for investing
    - Funds set aside by a company to invest in ESG stuff
    - Funds an investment broker uses to invest in ESG initiatives on behalf of clients
- Green investments programme (MAS)
    - MAS offers incentives for green investments
    - Read on the website
- Sustainability bond grant (MAS)
    - Co-share risks – contribute some money

**What is a bond** 

- It's like a loan
- If you issue a bond, you are offering a contract for ppl to loan you money. In return people get a certain return rate at the end of the contract

**What is a loan** 

- Bonds are usually larger in value (few million)
- Loans have smaller amounts

**Green finance in SG**

- Lack of green standardisation causes definitions to be uncertain and thus uninvestible
- GCNS – global compact network Singapore
- dominanted by big players, most critical high ticket items such as industrialization estates and large investments (due to strict risk profile constraints)

**SMEs**

- Left out in green finance plan
- SMEs contribute to 47% of SG's nominal value add to the economy (basically 47% of the economy – economic value of products produced by companies in SG) nominal — not accounting for taxes etc
![[Untitled 10.png]]
    - 47% of consumption value
- SMEs make up the large majority of companies in SG, >90%
- SMEs face a perpetual lack of capital
- SMEs lack understanding, expertise
- Inadequate data and disclosure to think about sustainability and manage it

**Chew's agriculture**

- Signed 10 year 27mil sustainability-linked loan with DBS
- The loan has lower interest rates when Humane Farm Animal Care standards are met
    - Livestock's feed
    - Environmental design
    - Responsible management of livestock
- Criteria for sustainability-linked loan may change in the middle of the loan
- Criteria for lower interest rates vary from contract to contract

**Lucrum capital** 

- Private equity investment firm
- UOB Green loan – real estate sustainable finance framework
- Uses loan to enhance green features of their hotel project e.g. climate-responsive features
- The bank checks for compliancy – they have a fiduciary duty

Lack of transparency in financial measures 

Green Investments Programme – MAS gives $2.4bn to asset managers to invest in ESG – not for corporations to use, but it is basically investing taxpayer money into ESG projects

Sustainability Bond Grant – encourages issuers of bonds to issue more sustainability bond grants by giving them $$

**Barriers faced by SMEs**

- Large initial capital – solved by current grants
- Information
- Admin processes

**Questions**

- You can only regulate stuff for things that are in the contract.
- Task force for climate related disclosures (TCFD)
- Regulators usually have a more graduated approach
- Coal is profitable. Technically MAS can say all companies can stop investing in coal-fired power plant but they want to take a gradual approach
- FInancial sector is very focused on short-term gain; climate change does not affect risk analysis of financial institutes as they have a 10 year risk rassessment but climate change risks only evident further down the road
- Whether measure is effective depends on particular contract and measure
- Fintech – e.g. sustainability tankings based on algorithms
