# Benefits of algae farming

- Biofuel production
- CO2 absorption

# Caveats

- Biofuel is high volume, low value
- To meet fuel demands, algae farms have to be scaled up, but this is currently not possible
    - Design constraints – current systems not designed to be carbon neutral
    - Cost constraints (esp. for closed photobioreactors)
- Difficult to maintain optimal conditions for growth, lipid synthesis
- Difficult to keep algae sterile (contamination is common), especially in open systems (e.g. raceway ponds)
    - Closed photobioreactors suffer from fouling periodically as well
- In open environments, algae face contamination from predators, competing photosynthetic organisms, or colonising organisms

# Relevant ecological principles

**Establish a climax community**

- Climax communities can resist colonization well as niches have ben filled
- In comparison, algal monocultures are too homogenous with many unfilled niches
    - Instead of culturing monocultures, algae should be cultured in a synthetic community of selected co-habitants that can increase the productivity of the culture
- Community structure affects algal productivity

**Introduce stabilizing interactions**

- Macrophytes stabilize clear water state by reducing suspension of sediments and suppressing algal growth
- States depend on nature of higher trophic levels
- Algal-bacterial mutualisms
    - Mutualistic bacteria competitively exclude contaminating bacteria ⇒ competitive enhancement
- Use predators (top-down control) to select for certain algal strains or communities
    - E.g. Introduce gape-limited zooplankton to favour growth of larger microalagal species

**Productivity-diversity relationship**

- "Diverse communities are more productive compared to species-poor communities living in a similar environment"
- When a community is species rich, all possible niches are filled, so all possible resources are used efficiently

**Ecosystems have alternative states**

- Switching freshwater systems to a clear-water state is very challenging, which suggests that an algal-dominated state is more stable
