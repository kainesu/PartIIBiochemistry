Exponential increase in ability to read, write DNA 

- Multiplex
- Molecular transistors (Roswell)
- Oxford nanopore

Technologies for endangered species

- Extinction prevention
- Biodiversity
- In vitro gametes & embryos
- Carbon sequestration

New alleles

- Large scale genome editing
- Size, blood, fat, sensory, ears, hair, tusks, pathogens

Multiplex editing 

- Niu et al 2017
- Ng, Khoshakhlagh et al (2020)
- Multiplex accurate enome engineering (MAGE)
    - Non-standard amino acids
    - Genetic and metabolic isolation
    - Multi-virus resistance
- Genomically recoded organisms

De-extinction of alleles (Campbell et al 2010) 

- Mammoth hemoglobin revived
- Stronger heme-oxygen affinity at lower temperatures → ensures oxygen ofloading to distal tissues

Applying for PhD? 

- Look for where iGem teams exist
- San diego, seattle, boston, new york...

DNA computing 

- 

Without big government subsidies, will be hard to fund synthetic biology solutions to sustainability

- E.g. rewilding bison – needed huge subsidy from US govt
- Definitely a race to solve the issues

Directed evolution?

- Machine learning limited by the language of developmental biology

Synthetic biology advantages for reducing carbon emissions? 

- Not either or – physical, chemical methods may be better in certain environments, biology in others?

Introducing engineered bacteria into existing microbial communities

Modelling ecosystems – to see how a mammoth would affect
