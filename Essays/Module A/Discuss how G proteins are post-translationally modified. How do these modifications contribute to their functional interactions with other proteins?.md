**Discuss how G proteins are post-translationally modified. How do these modifications contribute to their functional interactions with other proteins?**

# **Introduction**

G proteins are an abundant class of proteins that are able to bind GTP and GDP, frequently acting as molecular switches for signalling pathways in the cell. A number of post-translational modifications of G proteins have been observed that confer different properties and function to the G protein, including constitutive ones (i.e. lipidation), while others are conditional (e.g. phosphorylation, and ubiquitination). These modifications allow G proteins to be localized to different membranes, alter their conformations, or even affect the efficiency of GTP-GDP exchange, which all ultimately affect their interactions with other proteins.

# **1. Post-translational modifications, mainly lipidation, affect the localization of G proteins in the cell, spatially regulating their interaction with other proteins. **

G proteins are often found associated with the plasma membrane and endomembranes, but do not themselves contain hydrophobic regions that interact directly with membrane lipids. Instead, G proteins are constitutively lipidated with fatty acid chains that differ based on the particular family of G proteins, and it is this post-translational modification that allows G proteins to interact with membranes. 

Small G proteins are lipidated via modification of a C-terminal CAAX sequence that is conserved across all small G proteins. This CAAX sequence is recognised by three enzymes that sequentially modify the motif to create a lipidated, hydrophobic domain. Firstly, CAAX is recognised by a pair of cytosolic prenyltransferases that attach a polyisoprene lipid via a stable thioester linkage to cysteine. In the Ras family, this lipid is usually a farnesyl group, for Rho it is a geranyl geranyl group, and for Rab there is a double geranyl geranyl group. For HRAS and NRAS, a further palmitoylation step occurs after farnesylation. After lipidation, the prenylated CAAX sequence becomes a substrate for Rce1, an endoprotease that removes the AAX residues. Lastly, the C-terminal prenylated cysteine is recognised by the carboxyl methyltransferase, Icmt, which methyl esterifies the α-carboxyl group of the prenylcysteine. 

[Steps of small G protein processing] 

The lipidated domain this produces allows the small G protein to associate with the membrane, and this constrains the mobility of the G protein to just two dimensions so as to facilitate its interactions with GTPase-activating proteins (GAPs) and guanine nucleotide exchange factors (GEFs) that also interact with the membrane. In the particular case of Ras, its GEFs (e.g. SOS) also localise to the membrane by interacting with membrane proteins (via SH2 domains) or with membrane phospholipids (via PH domains). As such, when upstream proteins in the Ras signalling pathway are activated by some external stimulus (e.g. epidermal growth factor receptor), the activatory signal can rapidly be transmitted to Ras to induce a quick response from the cell. In addition, it has been more recently discovered that these lipid modifications can partition G proteins into membrane microdomains that can further restrict its mobility. Palmitoylation, for example, enhances the interaction between HRAS and NRAS with lipid rafts, such that they occupy distinct microdomains in the plasma membrane. Hence, the post-translational modification helps to colocalize G proteins with other signalling components for efficient signalling. 

Another point of interest is that palmitoylation in particular is a reversible post-translational modification due to the labile thioester linkage between the palmitoyl group and the cysteine. This property is what allows for a palmitoylation/depalmitoylation cycle to regulate the trafficking of NRAS and HRAS between the plasma membrane and the Golgi apparatus, thus determining the sets of proteins NRAS and HRAS can interact with over space and time. When the Ras proteins are palmitoylated, they are affinity trapped in a membrane compartment and transported to the plasma membrane on vesicles. After some time, depalmitoylation can occur to release the Ras proteins back into the cytosol to be trafficked to the Golgi. Goodwin et al (2005) used FRAP to show that NRAS and HRAS to translocate between the PM and the Golgi in a palmitoylation-dependent manner. When palmitoylation was inhibited with 2-bromo-palmitate, it caused the fraction of NRAS associated with the ER and Golgi to increase. While palmitoylation is thought to be constitutive as no regulator for palmitoyl acyltransferases (e.g. DHHC9-GPC16) have been found, depalmitoylation may be regulated by another post-translational modification – peptidylprolyl isomerisation. In HRAS, the cis/trans isomerization of the Gly-Pro peptidyl-prolyl bond regulates the rate at which HRAS is depalmitoylated. Application of FK506, an inhibitor for the prolyl isomerase FKBP12, resulted in inhibited HRAS depalmitoylation. Thus, isomerisation acts as a “molecular timer” for the half-life of each HRAS isoform, and together with palmitoylation acts as a temporal regulator of Ras protein interactions by regulating the time it spends in different cellular compartments. 

[Diagram] 

Apart from lipidation, ubiquitination can also regulate the trafficking of HRAS to and from endosomes, with ubiquitinated HRAS being restricted to endosomes, which apparently reduces MAPK signalling. 

# **2. Post-translational modifications can modify the affinity of G protein interactions with other proteins, which may have implications for signalling. **

Apart from regulating the localization of G proteins, post-translational modifications may also directly modify the affinity of the G protein for other proteins to alter its interactions. One consequence is that signalling is affected due to differences in how the G protein interacts with downstream effector proteins. For example, in the heterotrimeric G proteins, N-myristoylation may be required for inhibition of adenylyl cyclases _in vivo_. Taussig et al (1993) found that N-myristoylated Gα<sub>i </sub>inhibited adenylyl cyclase activity in Sf9 membranes upon activation, while nonmyristoylated Gα<sub>i </sub>did not. Presumably, this effect is due to changes in the conformation of the Gα caused by the post-translational modification, which might be better understood via cryo-EM to see how the structure of Gα changes upon N-myristoylation, as well as how the modification influences its interaction with Gβγ or adenylyl cyclase. 

However, N-myristoylation is a constitutive modification, so while it is necessary for the normal functioning of heterotrimeric G proteins, it is unlikely to be a source of regulation. In contrast, a conditional modification could modify the G protein properties for it to function differently under different cellular contexts. In some heterotrimeric G proteins, the Gα and Gγ subunits can be phosphorylated. For example, Gα<sub>z </sub>can be phosphorylated by protein kinase C at Ser27, which blocks its interaction with Gβγ as the modification blocks the N-terminal binding site for Gβγ. This promotes the dissociated state of the heterotrimer and frees each subunit to interact with their respective downstream effector proteins. Phosphorylation also provides the potential for cross-talk between pathways; some Gα<sub>i</sub> are known to be phosphorylated on tyrosine residues _in vitro_ by insulin receptor kinase. 

[Diagram] 

A second consequence is that post-translational modifications can modify the guanine-nucleotide exchange rate of G proteins, which could also affect downstream signalling. One important interaction that modifies this exchange is the interaction between the prenylated small G proteins and guanine nucleotide dissociation inhibitors (GDIs). Prenylation is required for this interaction. The GDIs have a hydrophobic cleft that bind to the isoprene units of the modification, which masks the membrane binding isoprenyl group and hence keeps the G protein in the cytosol. It also has the additional function of inhibiting dissociation of GDP, thus maintaining the G protein in its inactive state until an appropriate stimulus induces dissociation of the GDI. Without the prenylation, the small G proteins would have lowered affinity for their respective GDIs, which would affect how it interacts with downstream signalling proteins. On the other hand, for conditional modifications that affect guanine nucleotide exchange, monoubiquitination of KRAS4B on Lys104 and Lys147 can lead to enhanced GTP loading due to impairment of GAP-mediated GTP hydrolysis. In contrast, monoubiquitination of Lys117 in HRAS promotes Ras activation due to faster nucleotide cycling, rather than by interfering with GAP interactions. A similar post-translational modification thus leads to the same result for the G protein but via different mechanisms. By altering with guanine-nucleotide exchange, the proportion of G proteins in their active vs inactive state at steady state will also be altered, which would affect the rate of signalling to downstream effectors.  

[Diagram] 

It is also worth mentioning that some post-translational modifications that affect guanine nucleotide exchange may not be carried out by the cell, but by pathogens. A prime example of this would be how the cholera toxin causes ADP-ribosylation of Gα<sub>s</sub>, which inhibits its GTPase activity such that it becomes constitutively active. ADP-ribosylated Gα<sub>s </sub>can then continuously activate adenylate cyclase activity, eventually leading to the constitutive activation of the CFTR chloride channel that is responsible for rapid fluid loss from the intestines. Here, a post-translational modification is shown to affect how a G protein interacts with other proteins in the context of disease. 

# **3. Post-translational modifications can affect the half-life of G proteins to vary their concentrations in the cell, which modifies interactions with other proteins en masse. **

As a final note, like many other proteins, G proteins can also undergo proteasomal degradation, which affects their half life. Degradation of G proteins reduces their concentrations in the cell, which does not affect the interactions of individual G proteins, but will reduce the rate of collective interactions for that species of G protein. For HRAS, polyubiquitin-dependent degradation occurs upon recruitment of the SCF-β-TrCP E3 ligase, once HRAS is phosphorylated by glycogen synthase kinase 3. 



* 2 PTMs lead to recruitment of proteasome → new protein interaction
* Degradation then affects interaction with interacting partners 

# **Conclusion **

Post-translational modifications are crucial to the normal functioning of G proteins when constitutive, as well as to their spatial and temporal regulation when conditional. Given the number of signalling pathways that G proteins are involved in, it may not be surprising that these modifications are necessary to ensure the fidelity of each pathway, and that modification of G proteins can be exploited by pathogens. With our current understanding of G proteins, researchers have also been able to exploit the key role of PTMs to develop new cancer therapeutics, including geranylgeranyl transferase inhibitors and ICMT inhibitors, which are expected to disrupt signalling by oncogenic Ras. Indeed, the case of G proteins shows that our studies of the proteome cannot stop at the protein’s native sequence, but rather that PTMs are themselves critical parts of protein structure too.

**Lipidation in small G proteins is important to membrane localization and hence G protein function **



* Small G proteins have 4 conserved C-terminal residues (CAAX box) 
    * CAAX sequence is recognised by three enzymes that sequentially modify the motif to create a lipidated, hydrophobic domain 
    * Mechanism of CAAX prenylation 
        * CAAX sequence is recognised by a pair of cytosolic prenyltransferases that attach a polyisoprene lipid via stable thioester linkage to cysteine  
        * Prenylated CAAX sequences become substrates for Rce1 which is an endoprotease that removes AAX (“axing”) 
        * C-terminal prenyl cysteine is recognised by carboxyl methyltransferase Icmt that methyl esterifies α-carboxyl group of prenylcysteine 
        * If X =/= Leu/Phe, it is farnesylated via FTase 
        * If X = Leu/Phe, it is geranylgeranylated via GGTase 
    * Exposed C-terminal carboxylic acid group is methylated 
    * Lipid modification serves to anchor small G proteins to the membrane to correctly localise it for signalling – necessary (but not sufficient) 
* Examples of CAAX modification in different small G proteins 
    * Ras family proteins tend to be farnesylated, though nto all 
        * Penultimate cysteines in H-Ras and N-Ras have to be further palmitoylated after farnesylation for their correct function 
        * In contrast, K-Ras does not have further C-terminal cysteine residues and is not palmitoylated
    * Most of Rho family are prenylated with a geranyl geranyl group 
    * Rab proteins mostly undergo double geranyl geranylation on C-terminal cysteine motifs
        * CAAX box can contain two C residues 
        * Rab GDI – C-terminal domain binds to GG group.
            * Since Rab GDI involved in membrane recycling of Rab proteins, GG group important to functional interaction 
    * Arf proteins are lipid modified after removal of N-terminal Met and addition of myristic acid at N-terminus
    * Ran is not post-translationally modified. 
* **Membrane localization **
    * Farnesylation can also act as a lipid anchor to localize G protein to the membrane
        * Farnesyl transferase inhibitors are potential therapeutics for Ras 
            * CAAX analogues (peptidomimetics) – competitive inhibition. 
            * Small molecule FTase inhibitors
    * Membrane localisation is important to G protein function – may be required for activation and signalling 
        * E.g. for Ras 
        * Membrane association constrains Ras in two dimensions – facilitate interactions with GEFs, GAPs
            * Ras GEFs also localize to membrane via domains that bind membrane proteins (e.g. SH2) or membrane phospholipids (e.g. PH) 
        * Activated Ras can recruit effectors to membranes e.g. Raf1 → act as membrane tether for proteins 
        * Disrupting localization can be a therapeutic strategy. 
    * Constitutive modification 
    * PTMs also involved in partitioning Ras into membrane microdomains 
        * Bring together multiple signalling components 
        * Palmitoylation enhances association with lipid rafts –HRAS, NRAS, and KRAS4B occupy distinct plasma membrane microdomains
    * Phosphorylation of GTP-bound KRAS4B on Ser181 reduces nanoclustering 
* **Regulation of nucleotide change efficiency **
    * “ubiquitin modification at lysine 117 in HRAS promotes RAS activation due to faster nucleotide cycling, rather than by disrupting GAP interactions”
* **Interaction with proteins **
    * Lipidation allows for interaction with guanine nucleotide dissociation inhibitors (GDIs) 
        * GDIs can extract Ras/Rho/Rhab proteins form the membrane 
        * They bind with high affinity to <span style="text-decoration:underline;">prenylated</span> small G proteins and maintain the G proteins in an inactive state in the cytoplasm until an appropriate stimulus induces dissociation of the complex and concomitant membrane association of the small G protein 
        * GDIs have hydrophobic cleft (C-terminal Ig-like domain) for binding to isoprene units → mask membrane binding isoprenyl group → keep G protein in soluble form in the cytosol 
        * GDIs thus prevent g protein function by sequestering it in the cytosol → demonstrated importance of PTM (and membrane association) for g protein function 
    * Ubiquitylation – KRAS4B is monoubiquitinated on Lys104 and Lys147, which leads to enhanced GTP loading 
        * If KRAS4B also has a V12 mutation, it increases affinity for RAF1 and PI3K
        * Monoubiquitination does not significantly alter nucleotide exchange, but impairs GAP-mediated GTP hydrolysis 
        * Also, ubiquitination can lead to interaction with ubiquitin-binding proteins – “polyubiquitin-dependent degradation occurs upon recruitment of -TrCP–E3 ligase after HRAS phosphorylation by glycogen synthase kinase 3.” 
    * Glucosylation – glucosylation of RAS inhibits signalling to MAPK 
        * E.g. _Clostridium sordelli_ is a monoglucosyltransferase that uses UDP-glucose as a substrate glucosylate RAS on Thr35 
    * ADP-ribosylation – affects interaction with GEFs 
        * _Pseudomonas aeruginosa_ exoenzyme S (ExoS) can ADP-ribosylate R41 and R128 of RAS, inhibiting guanine nucleotide exchange factor-catalysed nucleotide exchange 
* **Regulation of function **
    * [S-nitrosylation](https://www.pnas.org/doi/10.1073/pnas.1037299100?url_ver=Z39.88-2003&rfr_id=ori%3Arid%3Acrossref.org&rfr_dat=cr_pub++0pubmed) – S-nitrosylation of Cys118 in Ras isoforms and orthologues leads to enhanced guanine nucleotide exchange → more efficient RAS activation
* **Regulation of protein trafficking **
    * A palmitoylation/depalmitoylation cycle regulates trafficking of NRas and HRas between PM and Golgi. “NRAS and HRAS are palmitoylated on the Golgi apparatus and affinity trapped in a membrane compartment, transported to the plasma membrane on vesicles and, after a certain period of time, depalmitoylated there and released back into the cytosol”
        * Palmitoyl lipids are reversible due to labile thioester linkage 
        * Goodwin et al – uses FRAP to show that NRas and HRas can translocate from PM to Golgi 
            * When Golgi was bleached in cells expressing GFP-NRas and treated with cycloheximide to block new protein synthesis, 75% of fluorescence was recovered with half-life of &lt;1 min 
            * NRas and HRas that could not be palmitoylated was found by FRAP to recover on Golgi and ER membranes 
        * Palmitoylation causes farnesylated Ras to be retained in the Golgi – Ras that is both farnesylated and palmitoylated has more than 100-fold higher affinity 
        * Depalmitoylation causes HRas/NRas to be trafficked in an anterograde manner back to Golgi from plasma membrane 
        * Palmitoylation is thought to be constitutive since no regulator for any PAT (e.g. DHHC9–GPC16) has been found, though depalmitoylation may be regulated 
    * For KRAS4B, it has a polybasic region that acts as the second signal for trafficking to the plasma membrane that forms electrostatic interaction with negatively charged head groups of inner plasma membrane leaflet 
    * Ubiquitylation – regulates trafficking of HRAS to and from endosomes 
        * When HRas is not ubiquitylated, it is not present on endosomes, while HRas that is ubiquitylated is present 
        * Ubiquitin-mediated endosomal restriction of HRAS was associated with reduced MAPK signalling → localization of Ras affects spatial control of signalling 
* **Regulation of membrane affinity **
    * Farnesylation is a modification for proteins that require lower and reversible affinity for membranes
        * Farnesylated Rho is below threshold for membrane association – requires AAX proteolysis and carboxyl methylation 
        * In vitro liposome binding data – methyl esterification of carboxyl group of prenylated CAAX peptide results in minimal added binding affinity when geranylgeranyl modification used, while binding affinity increased 20-fold for farnesylation (Silvius & l’Heureux 1994) - measured via fluorometry 
    * Geranylgeranylation is for proteins requiring higher affinity 
        * GG confers sufficient hydrophobicity for Rho to associate with membranes 
    * Peptidyl­prolyl isomerization – FKBP12, a cis-trans prolyl isomerase, may be involved in regulating RAS depalmitoylation. 
        * Extent of HRAS palmitoylation depends on presence/absence of Pro at position 79 in HVR 
            * FK506 which inhibits prolyl isomerase activity of FKBP12 inhibited HRAS depalmitoylation 
            * Cis-trans isomerization of the Gly-Pro peptidyl-prolyl bond regulates the rate at which HRAS is depalmitoylated – acts as a “molecular timer” 
    * Phosphorylation – Phosphorylation of Ser181 in the polybasic region of KRAS4B by protein kinase C causes it to lose affinity for the plasma membrane and accumulate on endomembranes (farnesyl-electrostatic switch) 
        * Rho family RND3 also regulated this way 

**Heterotrimeric G proteins **



* Lipid modifications on Gα subunits 
    * G protein a (Ga) subunits undergo Nmyristoylation (co-translationally) and/or palmitoylation (post-translationally) 
    * **PTM is required targeting and for other PTMs **– Membrane anchorage of Gαi conforms to a two-signal membrane trapping model 
        * Initial N-myristoylation is needed to transiently target Gαi to a membrane that is capable of palmitoylation, and upon palmitoylation at the conserved cysteine residue in position 3, the interaction becomes stronger and membrane anchorage becomes more fixed
            * E.g. plasma membrane – has protein acyltransferases and/or palmitoyl-CoA 
            * Usually N-myristoyl CoA transferase cotranslationally adds C14:0 myristic acid to the N-terminal Gly after removal of initiator Met in sequence MGXXXS 
        * Alternatively, the geranylgernayl group on Gγ could act as first lipid in the trapping model 
            * Mutation of Gαz in CHO cells to prevent N-myristoylation results in mislocalization to cytosol and nucleus (instead of plasma membrane). However, overexpression of Gβγ partially rescues plasma membrane localization (Morales et al 1998) 
        * N-myristoylation may also promote palmitoylation outside of just targeting Gα to the membrane. Some possibilities suggested by Chen and Manning (2001) are improving recognition by palmitoyl transferases or protecting it from palmitoyl esterases 
            * Wang et al (1999) – mutation of Gαo to prevent interaction with  Gβγ and N-myristoylation prevented palmitoylation even when it could still be targeted to the plasma membrane 
            * Not known how N-myristoylation promotes palmitoylation post-targeting. Possible experiments: 
    * Lipid modifications important to targeting to lipid rafts within the membrane → facilitate specific interaction with other proteins that colocalize to the lipid rafts
* C-terminal modifications on Gγ 
    * Also contains CAAX – C can undergo prenylation, farnesylation or geranylgeranylation
    * Lipidation anchors Gγ to membrane independently of Gα
* **Lipidation can facilitate protein interactions **
    * N-myristoylation promotes an increase in affinity of Gαi for Gβγ → signalling?
    * N-myristoylation may be required for inhibition of adenylyl cyclase _in vitro _
        * “N-myristoylated recombinant Gai from E. coli inhibited adenylyl cyclase activity in Sf9 membranes upon activation, whereas nonmyristoylated Gai did not” (Taussig et al 1993) 
        * “Affinity of Gz GAP for palmitoylated Gaz was reduced as compared to that for nonpalmitoylated Gaz. Additionally, the maximal rate of GTP hydrolysis promoted by Gz GAP was reduced for the palmitoylated subunit. Both the aÅnity and GTPase activity were restored upon removal of palmitate by dithiothreitol.” (Tu et al 1997) → palmitoylation affects rate of GTP hydrolysis → dampen efficiency of signalling?
* **Changes in PTMs over time allow for dynamic regulation of G protein functional interactions **
    * Palmitoylation – reversible 
        * Change in palmitoylation state can turn on/off specific protein interactions and localization depending on the needs of the cell ⇒ temporal and spatial regulation 
        * “Palmitoylation of Gai is subject to regulation upon its activation by a G protein-coupled receptor”
            * E.g. 5-HT<sub>1A</sub> receptor promotes palmitate exchange on endogenous Gαi in CHO cells 
        * “Regulation depalmitoylation upon activation leads to translocation of the subunit from plasma membrane to cytosol, thus limiting the proximity to membrane-bound effectors and dampening signal”
* Some Gα and Gγ subunits are phosphorylated → may modify signal amplitude and duration 
    * Gαz can be phosphorylated by protein kinase C,  mainly at Ser27, and secondarily at Ser16 
        * Phosphorylation of Gαz blocks Gβγ, and conversely phosphorylation cannot occur if Gβγ is bound to Gαz as it would block the N-terminal domain where PKC binds to 
            * Experimental evidence: Fields & Casey 1995, Wang et al 1999 
        * Phosphorylation also inhibits interactions with RGS proteins, e.g. RGSZ1, GAIP
        * Inhibition of these interactions may prolong activation of Gαz → signalling 
    * Gγ12 can be phosphorylated at the first serine of the SSK motif at the N-terminus 
        * This increases the affinity of Gβγ12 for Gαo and Gαi to some extent (EE – Morishita et al 1995) 
        * “The formation of a more stable heterotrimer may account for the increase in potency (several-fold) of phosphorylated Gbg12 in supporting high-aÅnity agonist binding to receptor (Yasuda et al., 1998). Phosphorylation in this latter study was also noted to have an eect on Gbg12 interaction with an eector, adenylyl cyclase, as shown by inhibition (a doubling of Kact)ofGbg12-mediated stimulation of adenylyl cyclase type II.” 
    * **Cross-talk between pathways**. “Some Gai family members are phosphorylated on tyrosine residues in vitro by the insulin receptor kinase”
        * 
* ADP-ribosylation of Gα<sub>s</sub> by cholera toxin (disease) 
    * Prolongs activation state → persistent stimulation of adenylyl cyclase 
* ADP-ribosylation of Gα<sub>i</sub> by pertussis toxin disrupts interactions of with GPCRs 
    * Toxin modifies conserved C residue in receptor interface of Gi proteins 

**Generally, the consequences of post-translational modification are to**



* Modify localisation of the G protein (membrane anchorage) 
* Regulate interaction between subunits (in heterotrimeric G proteins) 
* Affect guanine nucleotide exchange rates → affect rate of interaction with other proteins downstream for signalling? 
* Regulate interaction with other proteins, which results in changes in signalling with varying downstream effects, e.g. changes in gene expression, changes in metabolic activity

* FTase inhibitors were invented but lacked efficacy because of alternative prenylation 
    * IN the absence of FTase, KRas and NRas could be geranyl geranylated 
* Currently, GG inhibitors and ICMT inhibitors are being developed
