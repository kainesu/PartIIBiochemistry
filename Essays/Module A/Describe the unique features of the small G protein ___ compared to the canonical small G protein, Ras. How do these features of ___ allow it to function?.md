**Describe the unique features of the small G protein ___ compared to the canonical small G protein, Ras. How do these features of ___ allow it to function?**

Not necessarily structural features, could also be how it is activated/deactivated, interacts with effectors, etc. 

Ran and Arf have been tested before – probably Rab/Rho ?

## Arf – vesicular transport 
- Involved in selection of cargo for incorporation into carriers
- Arf acts as a coincidence detector to initiate vesicle formation 
	- Interswitch region – conserved Asp mimics charge on gamma phosphate, so need to displace it for GTP to bind -> nucleotide exchange requires both GEFs and membrane association 
- Insertion of N-terminal helix helps to deform membrane 
- GTP hydrolysis mediates disassembly 
- Binds coatomer 
- In membrane, binds adaptor for PIP4,5 (Fapp1) 
- Co-activated by COP I

## Rab – vesicular transport 
- Localised to cytosolic face of distinct intracellular membranes
- Cycle between membranes
- Tethering 

One mechanism by which vesicles are targeted to destination membranes is via tethering. Tethering involves linkage between vesicle and target membranes that extend over 200-300 nm. Macromolecular complexes (called “tethers”) bring the vesicle closer to the target membrane to facilitate fusion by SNAREs. Tethering is Rab-dependent, and in fact many tethers are Rab GEFs. 

Distinct Rabs localise to different membrane compartments to regulate the specificity and directionality of membrane trafficking, e.g. Rab5 directs vesicle traffic from phagosome to lysosome, Rab9 directs vesicle traffic from late endosome to Golgi, etc.

| GTPase domain               | Some vesicles are linked by long coiled-coil proteins (e.g. EEA1). RabGTP can bind to these tethers, causing a conformational change in the helix that collapses it, bringing the two vesicles closer together for SNARE interaction.</br><br>GTP hydrolysis occurs upon recruitment of a GAP by the downstream Rab (see Rab conversion), which converts Rab to RabGDP. RabGDPs are recognised by GDIs which extract the Rab from the membrane, thus maintaining membrane identity.                                                                             |
| Double geranyl geranylation | For anchoring to membranes. Aggregation of Rabs into microdomains on membranes helps to assemble molecular machinery on membrane surface; diff microdomains may interact with different effectors e.g. Rab5 can interact with APPL or EEA1 in separate microdomains                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        |
| Switch regions              | Interact with effector proteins, which bind to GTP bound form of Rab.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      |
| Hypervariable region*       | Importance for effector binding depends on the specific Rab and effector pair                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              |
| Rab conversion              | After a resident tether/GEF recruits Rab, the Rab brings another GEF to recruit Rab for the downstream compartment. This downstream Rab in turn recruits the GAP for the upstream Rab. This ensures that each Rab is tightly associated to different compartments, since Rab-GDP will be recognised by GDIs that extract it from the membrane. E.g. Novick lab – Gyp1 GAP that acts on Ypt1 is recruited by the Golgi Rab, Ypt32. Ypt32 recruits the GEF Sec2 to activate the secretory granule Rab, Sec4. This initiates creation of a secretory vesicle. | 

*
- For Rab9a, hypervariable region has been an important determinant of effector binding (e.g. p40, TIP47) 
- For Rab5 effectors Rabaptin 5 and EEA1, they are much less dependent on the hypervariable domain for Rab binding 
- For Rab1 and GM130, HVR doesn’t matter, but for p115 it does

| GTPase domain       | VCA domain is the effector domain for WASP, but it is autoinhibited via binding to the G protein binding domain. Activated Cdc42 can bind to the WASP G-protein binding domain, freeing VCAto recruit monomeric actin and Arp2/3 to nucleate actin filaments.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              |
| Insert loop         | Unclear whether these interact with region, but some functional assays indicate its importance in transformation                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           |
| Dimerisation        | Nanoclustering of Cdc42 promotes dimerisation of WASP, which makes it a more potent activator of Arp2/3                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    |
| Lipid modifications | Localisation to distinct membrane compartments -> influence interactions with RhoGEFs and other downstream signalling pathways. E.g. RAC1 has secondary palmitoyl group; this increases its stability by targeting it to actin-linked, detergent-resistant membrane regions; E.g. palmitoylated Cdc42 in the brain does not interact with RhoGDI, so it becomes enriched at the plasma membrane                                                                                                                                                                                                            |
| Effector domain     | ACK, WASP contain a disordered G protein binding domain. Binding of Cdc42 causes the domain to adopt an ordered structure, forming an intermolecular beta sheet</br> <br>Cdc42-effector complex structure different from Raf-Raf – e.g. “WASP adopted an extended conformation, the N-terminal region contacts  switch  1, b2  and a5  of  Cdc42, adding  an irregular-strand  to  form  the  intermolecular-sheet.  TheC-terminal  region formed  a b-hairpin  followed  by  an a-helix, which packed against Cdc42 switch 2. This resulted  in  an  extensive  interface for (hydrophobic) interactions”</br> | 


# Conclusion 
All act as molecular switches between two states, with additional features that facilitate their particular function
