**What is the experimental evidence for internal motions in proteins? How do these motions contribute to an enzymeâ€™s function?**

# Introduction 
- Different conformational states of a protein can be found on an energy landscape
	- Relative population of each state
	- Energy barrier between conformational states 
- Internal motion 

# Experimental evidence 

## Fast motion
- Relaxation dispersion NMR 
	- R1 and 1H-15N NOEs 
		- ADK kinase 
- Time-resolved XFEL 
	- Carbon monoxide migration in haemoglobin
	- Photosystems 
- Order parameter S<sup>2</sup>

## Slow motion
- R2 relaxation rate 
- FRET
	- Hing movement/rotation of transporters/pumps (e.g. F-type/V-type ATPase)
	- Inorganic phosphatases (PPases) family II 
	- Hinge motion exposed active site 
- DHFR 

## Very slow motion 
- Amide proton exchange
- HDX-MS 
- Order parameter S<sup>2</sup>
