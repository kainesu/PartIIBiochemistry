**Introduction**   

G proteins are ubiquituous in the regulatory systems of cells, acting as molecular switches to turn signalling pathways on and off. Most small G proteins are similar to Ras, the canonical G protein, containing a nucleotide binding site for binding to GTP/GDP, and switch regions that change the signalling activity of the protein depending on its nucleotide state. On the other hand, heterotrimeric G proteins are a complex of three subunits, but are similarly regulated by their nucleotide state. Developing strategies that interfere with G protein signalling are important for research applications, in terms of understanding the functions of G proteins. It is also important for clinical applications, as inhibition of dysfunctional G proteins can treat disease. In this essay, I discuss four strategies for interfering with G protein signalling: targeting the direct targeting of G proteins, targeting G protein activators, targeting membrane localisation of G proteins, and targeting the interaction between the G protein and its effectors (Figure 1).   

**1. Direct targeting of G proteins**

For the small G proteins, Ras has been the most studied in terms of studying how to interfere with its signalling, given its importance in cancer development. One strategy that has been attempted is to target inhibitory molecules to its nucleotide binding site, in hopes of outcompeting GTP and thus preventing G protein activation. However, this is probably too difficult because the affinity of G proteins for GTP is in the picomolar range, while the concentation of GTP in the cell approaches micromolar levels. It is unlikely that a drug can be found that has even higher affinity for G proteins than GTP itself – the benchmark for most drugs bind is the nanomolar range. Hence, this strategy is unlikely to be fruitful in interfering with G protein signalling.   

A more successful approach would be to target non-catalytic sites on the small G proteins. Fragment-based drug discovery has been a useful technique, involving the screening of many small molecules (or "fragments") for binding against the G protein, then combining the different fragments together to form a high affinity ligand. For example, Sun et al (2012) used this technique and discovered a hydrophobic binding pocket that was not previously found on Ras. It was only exposed on ligand binding. Moreover, binding of the fragment induced formation of a second pocket in Ras, so the first fragment was grown to exploit this second pocket, increasing its affinity. These molecules were able to block KRAS from interacting with its guanine exchange factor (GEF), SOS. This study suggests that a successful approach may be to dock low affinity ligands into different sites onto G proteins, and monitor the protein for conformational changes that could reveal new binding pockets. 

For the heterotrimeric G proteins, targeting nucleotide binding in the Gα subunit may be somewhat easier due to the differences in structure between Gα and small G proteins. In Gαq, there is a hydrophobic cleft between the linkers that connect the GTPase and helical domain of Gαq. For nucleotide exchange, the interface between these two domains have to open. Nishimura et al (2010) exploited this cleft by synthesising a cyclic depsipeptide that binds to this cleft, thus preventing domain opening and stabilising the GDP bound form of Gαq. In this case, the traditional approach of exploiting hydrophobic pockets for binding was possible. Other subunits in the heterotrimeric G proteins might be targeted as well; for example, the SIGK peptide was discovered to bind to the interaction surface between Gβγ and Gα. 

**2. Targeting G protein activators**   

Another way we could prevent G protein activation is by interfering with the activity of their activators, GEFs. GEFs activate G proteins by catalysing the rate of nucleotide exchange. This generally involves disturbing the interaction betweens the switch regions, Mg2+, and other regions in the G proteins and the phosphates in GDP. Inhibiting the activity of GEFs would decelerate the rate of nucleotide exchange in G proteins, preventing them from activating and thus signalling. For example, Patgiri et al developed a stapled alpha-helical peptide that disrupts the interaction between Ras and its GEF, SOS. The peptide works by mimicking an alpha-helix on SOS that mediates the interaction with Ras. The peptide acts as competitive inhibitor.   

The heterotrimeric G proteins have two main activators, GPCRs and GBA motif proteins. GPCRs are highly druggable and many drugs have been developed that target GPCRs, including those that compete off ligands or bind to allosteric sites. The other type of activator, GBA motif proteins, are not as commonly inhibited, but there are some inhibitors that have been developed. For example, Leyme et al (2017) created a genetically encoded inhibitor of GBA motif proteins.This inhibitor protein was created by engineering a Gαi protein such that it could not interact with its major binding partners, while favouring binding to GBA motif proteins, resulting in a non-productive complex. In line with the work by Patgiri et al, it could be possible to further minimise the Gαi mimic to just the domain that interfaces with the GBA motif proteins. This would make it less likely to have any interaction with binding partners. 

**3. Targeting membrane localisation**  

Apart from G protein activation, we could also target the membrane localisation of G proteins. G proteins signalling is dependent on membrane localisation, as it positions them near their effectors and also allows for dimerisation, which further upregulates their signalling activity. Many small G proteins have prenyl chains that attaches them to membranes, and interfering with their prenylation could affect their localisation. This has been done before – farnesyl transferase inhibitors were developed to block Ras farnesylation. One class of FTIs worked by acting as CAAX analogs, CAAX being the recognition site on the small G proteins for farnesyl transferases. These analogs act as competitive inhibitors of the FTs. Small molecule FTase inhibitors were also developed. However, these FTIs are only effective if the small G protein does not have any secondary pathways of prenylation. When these FTIs were tested on KRAS, for example, it did not affect membrane localisation because KRAS could also be geranylgeranylated. On the other hand, HRAS localisation was affected because it did not have such a compensatory pathway.   

Another strategy for interfering with signalling wold be to prevent small G protein nanoclustering. Some G proteins, such as Ras, dimerise with each other to form nanoclusters when embedded in membranes. Disrupting this dimerisation could reduce signalling. For example, Spencer-Smith et al developed a monobody (NS1) that binds with nanomolar affinity to HRAS specifically at the α4-α5 interface. This prevented dimerisation, and the downstream effect was to prevent dimerisation of CRAF and BRAF, thus blocking signalling. 

Some small G proteins (Ras/Rho/Rab families) additionally interact with guanine nucleotide dissociation inhibitors, which deliver them to membranes. They maintain the small G protein in an inactive form in the cytoplasm by blocking GDP from being exchanged for GTP. Alternatively, interfering with the interaction between the small G protein and the GDI could prevent it from being delivered to membranes. For example, deltarasin inhibits the KRAS-PDEδ interaction, and its use in KRAS-dependent pancreatic cancer cells was found to suppress proliferation and MAP kinase signalling. However, these GDIs are also known to extract small G proteins (e.g. Rab) from membranes, so it could be possible that upregulating them would suppress their signalling activity. The effect of upregulating versus downregulating a GDI could depend on its particular function or the extent to which its activity is perturbed. 


**4. Targeting interactions between G proteins and effectors**   

If none of the above strategies are possible, then targeting the interaction between the G protein and its effectors could also neutralise signalling from the G protein, since it is the effectors that mediate the signalling of the G protein. For example, Vemurafenib is a drug that targets the interaction between Ras and V600E mutant BRAFs. This as found to block the proliferation of BRAF(V600E) cell lines _in vitro_. However, when patients were treated with Vemurafenib, it was found to upregulate the RAF-MEK-ERK pathway. This was because BRAF can exist as a heterodimer with CRAF apart from dimerising with itself. Inhibition of BRAF resulted in activation of CRAF, thus stimulating the RAF-MEK-ERK pathway. This particular example shows that when targeting interactions between G proteins and effectors, we need to be careful about what compensatory pathways are present that could be upregulated should we inhibit just one of the downstream pathways. Unfortunately, many small G proteins are pleiotropic and it could be difficult to inhibit all downstream pathways at the same time. Particularly for inhibitors intended for clinical use, inhibiting too many pathways could end up being toxic to the patient.   

Apart from inhibiting the effectors, we could target the interface on the small G protein that interacts with the effector. One creative strategy by Fang et al (2018) was to use the membrane itself to block the interaction surface. They developed a molecule, Compound II, which engages a shallow pocket on KRAS to stabilise it in an orientation where the membrane occludes the effector binding site. This prevents signalling of KRAS to its downstream pathways. A more traditional approach by Kessler et al (2019) made use of a small molecule to bind a pocket between the switch I and II regions of KRAS. Their small molecule disrupted interactions with GEF, GAP, and effectors. In addition, the crystal structure of the drug showed that it actually binds to two KRAS molecules, and stabilised KRAS in a non-productive orientation.   

**5. Which strategy would be best?**   

Many strategies for interfering with G protein signalling are possible and have been designed. However, which strategy should be chosen? I think there are several considerations here. Firstly, the efficacy of the strategy – some strategies may be more "leaky" than others. I think that targeting the downstream effectors of the G proteins is not the best strategy in this case since we are not targeting the source of the signalling, i.e. the G protein. The best strategies may be ones that totally block G protein signalling directly or even target the G protein for proteolysis (as was accomplished with protacs against Ras G12C).  

Another consideration would be the particular research question. If we want to investigate the function or importance of an aspect of G protein signalling, then we should choose the strategy that disrupts that avenue of signalling.   

For clinical applications, we would also need to consider the therapeutic index, as well as the possibility of acquired drug resistance in cancer. 

**Conclusion**   

In conclusion, we have seen that there are diverse ways to interfere with G protein signalling for both the small G and heterotrimeric G proteins. The diversity in strategies reflects the complexity of the G protein regulatory network. In the future, inhibitor discovery will likely be facilitated by technologies such as high throughput drug screening, structure-based drug design, and even directed evolution of biologics.

# Intro 
* G proteins are ubiquitous cell signalling regulators that act as molecular switches 
* However, interfering with G protein signalling can be useful in some cases: 
    * To experimentally understand the effects of G protein signalling on the cell 
    * To understand the mechanisms of G protein signalling 
    * To downregulate pathological G protein signalling 
* G protein signalling is regulated at several points, each of which can be disrupted to interfere with signalling  

# 1. Direct inactivation

* Small G proteins 
* Bind catalytic site 
    * Probably too difficult; e.g. Ras affinity for nucleotide is picomolar, while concentration of GTP approaches micromolar levels. Galpha probs the same since it binds to GTP with even higher affinity 
* Bind non-catalytic sites 
    * Ras G12C tethers – Covalent inhibitors can react with SH2 domain on mutant C to covalently bind to Ras 
        * Ostrem et al (2013) – Covalent binding induces formation of a new pocket beneath the effector binding switch-II region. Switch I and switch II are disrupted, such that Ras prefers to bind to GDP, and has impaired binding to Raf 
            * Binds selectively to mutant KRAS, so does not affect WT Ras 
* Target for degradation 
    * Protacs for Ras 
        * E.g. Bond et al (2020) 
* Heterotrimeric G proteins 
    * Inhibition of GDP/GTP exchange reaction in Galpha; e.g. Nishimura et al (2010) found that a cyclic depsipeptide inhibits GDP/GTP exchange reaction of Galphaq by inhibiting GDP release. The peptide binds a hydrophobic cleft between linkers that connect GTPase and helical domain of G alpha q, which stabilises GDP bound form 
        * GDP release requires interface between these domains to open, so binding of peptide at this hinge prevents domain opening 
    * Targeting Gbetagamma e.g. SIGK peptide binds to interaction surface on Gbeta that interacts with downstream targets and Galpha 

# 2. Inhibit activators 

* GEFs 
    * Disrupt GEF activity 
    * E.g. Ras-SOS interaction – Small molecule inhibitors and peptide mimetics have been developed. Crystal structure of Ras-SOS shows that SOS helix alphaH is involved in interaction between SOS and Ras, so can design alpha-helical peptides to compete with interaction 
        * E.g. Patgiri et al developed a stapled alpha-helical peptides that mimic alphaH of SOS 
* GPCRs
    * Highly druggable; many drugs have been developed that target GPCRs
    * Ligand binding 
    * Allosteric binding 
    * Biologics 
* GBA motif proteins 
    * Not commonly inhibited  
    * E.g. Leyme et al (2017) created a genetically encoded inhibitor of GBA motif proteins. This inhibitor protein was engineered by modifying Galphai to prevent interaction with all major binding partners, while favouring binding to GBA motif proteins 

# 3. Alter membrane interaction 

* Prevent prenylation 
    * Farnesyl transferase inhibitors 
        * CAAX analogs and modified CAAX analogs
        * Small molecule FTase inhibitors 
    * May be effective if the G protein doesn’t have secondary lipidation (e.g. HRAS) … but most do. Inhibition of secondary prenyl group probably cytotoxic (e.g. GGTase inhibitors) 
* Prevent nanoclustering 
    * Disrupt dimerisation interface 
        * E.g. Spencer-Smith et al developed a monobody (NS1) that binds with nM affinity to HRAS, KRAS; NS1 binds to HRAS at alpha4-alpha5 interface. This disruption of HRAS and KRAS dimerisation prevents CRAFt and BRAF dimerisation and signalling 
        * E.g. Bery et al generated ankyrin repeat proteins (DARPins) that bind to KRAS via a3-a4, which decreased KRAS-KRAS interactions 
    * Stabilise non-productive RAS-RAS complexes such that the RAS molecules cannot bind to their effectors 
        * E.g. Kessler et al (2019) – small molecule BI-2852 binds KRAS in a polar solvent exposed pocket between switch I and II regions. Crystal structure showed that two molecules of BI-2852 binds two KRAS molecules, and binding pose suggested that it stabilises KRAS in a nonproductive orientation; the main mode of action was really to disrupt interaction with GEF, GAP, and effectors, but the study supports this strategy by showing it could be possible 
* Reorient membrane protein so that it cannot interact with effector 
    * E.g. Fang et al (2018) 

# 4. Disrupt signalling to effectors 

* Small G proteins
    * Raf inhibitors 
        * First gen 
        * Second gen 
    * PI3K pathway  inhibition 
        * PI3K inhibitors – E.g. PX-866 is a modified version of Wortmannin, a mold metabolite. It inhibits PI3K directly by forming covalent interactions with a critical Lys residue in ATP binding site of PI3K, preventing it from phosphorylating PIP2 to generate PIP3 
        * AKT inhibitors –  e.g. ATP-competitive inhibitors, allosteric inhibition via inhibitor binding to PH domain 
    * Ral inhibition 
        * E.g. Thomas et al (2016) – Interaction between RALB and RLIP76 is mediated by an alpha-helix of RLIP76. An alpha-helical peptide stabilised by a chemical “staple” can act as a competitive inhibitor for RLIP76, thus inhibiting RALB signalling. In this case, the staple was a hydrocarbon chain formed via ruthenium-catalysed ring-closing metathesis between two unnatural amino acids with alpha-methyl, alpha-alkenyl side chains 
    * But development of drug resistance… 
        * Secondary mutations 
        * Also adaptive rewiring (Raf inhibitors) 
        * Combination inhibitors may be most effective to minimise evolution of drug resistance 

# 5. Upregulate terminators 

GAPs, RGSs 

* Can’t really find research on this… 
* Speculatively, could try to find ways to increase interaction between terminators and G proteins 
* Some GAPs may be activated by dimerisation, so dimerisation interface could be a target for interfering with signalling 
    * E.g. Wang et al (2012) – Plexins are GAPs for Rap GTPase. This RapGAP activity is activated by dimerisation 

# 6. Choice of technique 

* Efficacy 
    * Leakiness
* Aim – which part of G protein signalling to inhibit? 
* Side effects
    * Cell lethality – cannot really observe signalling 
    * Therapeutic index – if interference is intended to be used as a therapeutic. Some inhibitors ok for use in experiments only 

# Conclusion 

* There are diverse ways to inhibit G protein signalling 
    * Inhibit component 
    * Inhibit interaction surfaces 
    * Exploit endogenous regulatory pathways 
* Inhibitor discovery 
    * Drug screens 
    * Biologics – directed evolution 
    * Rational design 
* Diversity in strategies reflects the complexity of the G protein signalling network.
