**Explain why the outcomes of X-ray crystallography and NMR structural studies of the same membrane protein might differ and describe the possible implications of such a scenario.**

# Introduction 
- Difficulty of obtaining structures for membrane proteins 
- Brief comparison of how XRC and NMR work 
	- Physical basis for NMR, XRC 

# Reasons
- NMR studies protein dynamics and gives information from the entire population of protein conformations in solution – XRC studies the crystallised protein, which may have been ‘forced’ into a local energy minimum; this would obscure dynamic loops by making them appear as having a single conformation.
- Differences in experimental conditions – e.g. temperature, pH, ligand concentration, membrane mimetics
- XRC provides coordinates of electron density, whereas NMR gives structural restraints which simulated structures are fitted to. In interpreting XRC coordinates and assigning identities to each diffraction maximum, the potential for human error is much greater – in the worst cases, scientists have incorrectly assigned entire polypeptide backbones the wrong way around; or proteins being mapped as a mirror image. This isn’t just a theoretical possibility; papers _have_ been retracted over such mistakes. On the other hand, incorrect assignment of even a single NOE will be quite obvious, because it would disagree with the restraints.

# Implications
Mostly do agree-implications then that the structures are ‘correct’

Implications-if one is ‘correct’ then understand which is best to use e.g., with the M2 influenza channel and the ligand ratios involved (not actually mimetics on ligand probably but illustrative?)

Different mechanisms - VDAC-1 mitochondrial channel either electrostatic hinge (XRC) or hydrophobic anchor-flexible hinge (NMR)
