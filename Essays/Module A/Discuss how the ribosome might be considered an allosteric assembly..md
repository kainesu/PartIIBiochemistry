**Discuss how the ribosome might be considered an allosteric assembly.**

# Introduction 



* An allosteric assembly is an assembly of molecules where “the effect of binding at one site” is “transmit[ted]...  to another, often distal, functional site, allowing for regulation of activity” (Motlagh et al 2014) 
* The ribosome has multiple binding sites and sites at which it interacts with other molecules, including mRNA, tRNA, and elongation factors 
* These interactions cause conformational changes that can result in conformational shifts at distal sites, allowing the ribosome to act as a hub for interactions during translation 
* Ribosome undergoes large-scale conformational changes throughout translation 

# Points: 



* Allosteric three-site model 
    * Occupation of A site reduces E site affinity for tRNA, triggering its release
        * After decoding, EF-Tu hydrolyses GTP, EF-Tu-GDP leaves, aa-tRNA moves into A site (accommodation). E-tRNA is released after decoding step but before GTP hydrolysis and accommodation 
        * This results in only 2 tRNAs occupying ribosome at any time
    * Oppositely, occupation of E site reduces A site affinity for tRNA 
    * The allosteric three-site model is somewhat controversial though 
    * One recent study by Chen et al (2011) used single molecule FRET experiments to suggest that the allosteric model applies in early cycles of elongation, but not in later cycles. 
* Allostery is key to decoding – binding of cognate tRNA triggers a series of conformational changes throughout the ribosome that is transmitted to distal sites, e.g. SRL
    * Near-cognate do not trigger this series of allosteric changes 
* Also important to peptidyl transfer – induced fit. Upon binding of A site substrate, series of conformational changes in 23S rRNA exposes peptidyl tRNA ester for nucleophilic attack by the α-amine 
    *  First observed in structures of 50S subunit with minimal oligonucleotide substrates
    * Voorhees et al (2009) – Observed in X-ray crystal structures of whole ribosomes with intact A- and P-site tRNAs that mimic pre- and post-peptidyl transfer states 
    * Crystal structures of termination complexes report that RF1/2 binding to 70S ribosomes results in similar 23S rRNA structural changes 
    * So peptide hydrolysis (during peptide transfer or release) involves similar conformational changes. 
* Translocation 
    * Korostolev (2022) proposed that EF-G catalyses translocation by converting spontaneous ribosome fluctuations into tRNA movement. 
        * Evidence comes from experiments using non-hydrolysable GTP analogs and dead EF-G mutants. These still can catalyse translocation by magnitude of 3 orders, similar to GTP hydrolysis 
    * The ribosome adopts multiple conformations in response to interactions with EF-G. 
    * Allosteric changes are important for the ribosome to progress through different phases of translation, as elongation factors bind to overlapping sites on the ribosome. However, EF-Tu engages with an unrotated, locked configuration of the ribosome, while EF-G engages with a rotated, hybrid configuration, so they do not compete with each other (conformational selection model). 
* Ribosome can be allosterically controlled by small molecules 
    * E.g. Wang et al (2012) used X-ray crystallography to show that the drug neomycin can bind to helix 69 of the 23S rRNA, preventing rearrangements of interactions between the two subunits. This prevents subunit rotation, stabilising a partially rotated ribosome configuration that was not previously identified. 
        * H69 of the large subunit interacts with H44 of the small subunit. Remodelling this region allows SSU to rotate wrt LSU 
        * Because rotation is inhibited, neomycin binding 
* The ribosome is an intrinsically dynamic molecule, sampling globally distinct conformations that each have a preference for different substrates or substrate conformations. Allosteric regulation involves the stabilisation of particular configurations that enable the ribosome to perform a certain function. Binding at a certain site transmits the effect globally for stabilisation.
