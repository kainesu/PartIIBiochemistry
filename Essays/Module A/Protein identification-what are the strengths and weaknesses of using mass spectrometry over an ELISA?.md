# Mass spec 
## Strengths 
- Higher resolution 
- Wider scope – can analyse an entire proteome (*although may lose the less abundant ones.)
- No need for prior knowledge, don't need an existing antibody 
- Quantification possible with plexing 

## Limitations
- MS data analysis can be complex
- MS equipment more expensive, less accessible
- General limitations of MS 

# ELISA
## Strengths
- Specificity due to antibodies
- Quantification is easier, faster 
- Simple – no specialised data analysis needed 

## Limitations
- Limited scope – can only measure a few proteins at a time, not amenable to high throughput 
- Prior knowledge needed, since u need to have an antibody for it. cannot use ELISA to discover new proteins 
- Variability – ELISA results can vary depending on antibody quality and affinity; false negatives/positives can result 
- Need to purify sample or at least enrich for the protein of interest bc antibodies may show cross-reactivity 

# Choosing between MS or ELISA
- What is the research question? 
	- Identify new proteins -> MS
	- Measure known proteins -> ELISA 
- Sample complexity
	- Complex sample -> MS 
	- Simple -> ELISA 
- Throughput needs 
	- ELISA -> for high throughput of 1 sample 
	- Mass spec -> multiple proteins 
- Cost/equipment 
	- MS more expensive 
	- But if testing many proteins, ELISA can also be expensive 
- Specificity 
	- ELISA v specific bc of antibody 
- Quantification 
	- Both possible
- Time
	- ELISA faster to do + analyse
