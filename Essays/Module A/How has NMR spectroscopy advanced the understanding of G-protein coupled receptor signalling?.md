**How has NMR spectroscopy advanced the understanding of G-protein coupled receptor signalling?**

# Intro

* NMR is an ideal method for studying GPCR signalling
    * Difficult to crystallise as they are flexible, hydrophobic (membrane) proteins 
    * Highly dynamic, particularly allosteric changes 
    * Study weak and transient protein-ligand complexes 
    * Can study GPCRs in a variety of environments e.g. diff buffers, membrane mimetic systems 
    * But NMR not as often used to resolve a 3D structure, but more often used to answer specific questions 
* NMR can be used to link structure and dynamics of GPCRs to their roles in signalling  

# 1. NMR can be used to map the energy landscapes of GPCRs 

* Energy landscapes describe the relative energies of different GPCR conformational states, and the size of the energy barriers between these conformational states 
* Ligand binding can change the free energy of each state, which changes their relative equilibrium populations. 
    * Under the conformational selection model, GPCRs exist in a thermal equilibrium between multiple conformational states, and some states are more populated than others
    * Ligands bind to a subset of these conformations and stabilises them, resulting in a population shift 
    * E.g. a GPCR agonist might stabilise an active, signalling state of the GPCR, while an inverse agonist stabilises the inactive state 
* As such, understanding the energy landscape is important to clarifying how GPCRs function in signalling 
* Interpreting effect of ligands on GPCRs from NMR 
    * For an NMR label at a particular site, the presence of multiple peaks at different chemical shifts suggests multiple conformational states, and the rate of exchange between these states is a measure of the energy barrier (faster rate = lower energy barrier) 
    * NMR on GPCR incubated with a ligand can change the NMR spectra, either by changing the intensities of the peaks without changing their chemical shifts, or generating new peaks at different shifts 
        * Different intensities -> changing of populations of each conformational state
        * Different chemical shifts -> new conformations that become accessible in presence of ligand, or changes in exchange rate between existing populations 
* Visualise low populated intermediate states 
    * These states are often not seen in other structural techniques because they are rare or because they are higher in energy 
    * E.g. NMR studies have shown that GPCR inactive state is actually comprised of several states. 
        * 13C-labelled M82 in B2AR exhibits two signals in inverse agonist-bound state. 
        * 19F-labelled TM6 in A2aAR has two inactive conformations based on NMR, which may correspond to ionic lock between TM3 and TM6 being broken and formed 
        * E.g. visualisation of pre-active states – state of GPCR when bound to agonist but not to a G protein (or other intracellular binding partner)
            * This state is in exchange with inactive state 

# 2. Investigating the motion of GPCR structural elements

* If peaks can be assigned to particular structural elements within the GPCR, then their motions can be followed 
* Conformational changes are identified from changes in the properties of peaks on a 2D NMR spectrum 
    * Chemical shifts, intensities, line widths, and line shapes of peaks on NMR is related to the motions of proteins 
    * E.g. titrating B2AR with the agonist formoterol induces solution state NMR spectral changes of 13Cmethyl-B2AR, suggesting conformational changes in TM6 and 7 
    * The chemical shifts of key residues (e.g. TM5, TM6) in B1AR and B2AR are correlated with the efficacy of orthosteric ligands 
* This knowledge can be used to investigate how GPCR structural elements move in response to different conditions 
    * Dynamics at G protein binding site when GPCR incubated with different ligands 
        * **TM6 undergoes structural rearrangements upon GPCR activation due to conformational selection. **Upon activation, TM6 of the GPCR moves outwards to expose the G protein binding site; this has been studied using probes on a native cysteine
            * e.g. 19F-NMR – B2AR C265 labelled with 19F-trifluoroethanethiol showed that this region **undergoes a conformational change or rearrangement upon GPCR activation**. In the presence of different ligands (ranging from agonists to antagonists), the relative intensities of the peaks changed without generating new peaks, demonstrating that the ligands cause population shifts between pre-existing conformations of TM6 
            * With full agonist, B2AR exhibits a third state on NMR, and a drop in populations (relative intensities) of the two inactive states 
                * When nanobody that mimics G protein was added, a fourth state with diff chemical shift was observed 
        * There appears to be some **disagreement between studies over the effect of partial agonists** on the energy landscape of TM6 
            * In A<sub>2a</sub>R study using 19F label at base of TM6, Partial agonist and full agonists **stabilise different conformational states** in B2AR (based on NMR); the state stabilised by the full agonist had a more upfield chemical shift than the one stabilised by the partial agonist. This suggests that partial agonists stabilise a unique GPCR state that is less efficient at interacting with the G protein and thus has a lower signalling output 
            * On the other hand, in the study on 13C-Met B2AR, the partial agonist was found to** shift the equilibrium** towards an existing active state rather than stabilise a new conformational state 
    * Dynamics of agonist-G protein coupling 
        * **Differences in motions of Met near and distant from the G protein binding site suggest…? **
            * E.g. Kobilka group – M82 of B2AR was labelled with (13)CH(3)ε-methionine and HSQC spectra was obtained. In apo form or with inverse agonist, M82 shows two peaks, suggesting two conformational states (exchange rate was in millisecond scale). When agonist and G protein mimic was added, the two Met peaks shift. However, with the agonist alone, the Met peaks still appear to be similar to the ones in presence of nanobody, while other Met closer to G protein binding site are not, so there is some kind of intermediate 
        * **Difference in rate of motion within ligand binding pocket vs G protein binding pocket suggest inefficient allosteric coupling **
            * E.g. Liu et al (2012) – 19F-NMR on cysteine-attached probes at the tip of TM6 and TM7 on B2AR revealed that there are population shifts between an inactive and active state. The rate of exchange was slower on the NMR timescale compared to conformational changes around the ligand binding pocket. This suggests there is an inefficient allosteric coupling of conformational changes in ligand binding pocket to the G protein binding pocket 
    * Biased agonism – “Biased agonism, the ability of a receptor to differentially activate downstream signaling pathways” 
        * Different ligands can bias receptors to different downstream pathways. NMR has been used to show what conformational changes they induce in the GPCR to accomplish this. 

# 3. 3D structure determination 

* Solid state NMR methods have been used to determine the 3D structure of GPCRs
* E.g. Park et al (2012) published a structure of CXCR1 in phospholipid bilayers determined by a method called rotationally aligned solid state NMR, which combines features of magic angle spinning and oriented-sample SSNMR 

# Conclusion 

* NMR has revealed numerous functional insights about GPCRs
* These insights into GPCR structure and function have been used for the development of numerous drugs targeting GPCRs 
* By combining insights from NMR with those from XRC, fluorescence and EMR, and MD, can gain a holistic understanding of GPCRs
