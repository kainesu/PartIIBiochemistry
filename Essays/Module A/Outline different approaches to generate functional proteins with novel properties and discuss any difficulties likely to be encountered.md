**Outline different approaches to generate functional proteins with novel properties and discuss any difficulties likely to be encountered**

# **Properties** 
* Increased stability 
* Increased activity
    * Protein dynamics 
* New activity 
    * Rational design starting from a crude protein 
    * Biomining
    * Need to identify the catalytic mechanism  
* Different specificity
    * Catalytic promiscuity 

# **Approaches** 
A typical directed evolution campaign may look like this: 
1. Identify a starting sequence 
    1. Databases
    2. Biomining 
    3. Rational design
    4. Computational de novo design  
    5. Choosing a good starting sequence. 
2. Generate a library (fitness landscape) 
    6. What is a good library? 
        1. Size 
        2. Diversity 
3. Screening 
    7. What is a good screening strategy? Does it depend on the desired property?
    8. Criteria to consider
        3. Throughput 
        4. Practicality – rounds of screening needed, setup, etc. 
        5. Is readout representative of the desired function (e.g. fluorescence used in microfluidics = desired function?) 
        6. Step sizes
            1. Intermediate targets 
            2. Stringency – need to allow some buffer
        7. Negative and positive selection 
        8. Improved technology will prob help in the future (particularly advancements in microfluidics) 
4.  Getting around local optima 
    9. Recombination
    10. Increasing stability 

# **To what extent does the strategy chosen determine the properties of the catalyst? **
* Can any strategy achieve any desired property? 
* I think the choice of strategy matters in that it affects
    * Speed at which the desired property can be reached 
    * Accessibility of the desired property 
    * Combination of the desired property with other properties 

# **Difficulties for each goal.  **

# **Solutions to these difficulties to make the campaign more successful. **
