**Compare and contrast the small G proteins with heterotrimeric G proteins. Briefly speculate why these different mechanisms might have evolved.**

# Intro 
* Small G proteins – monomeric
* Heterotrimeric – Galpha (homologous to small G), Gbeta, G-gamma 
* Both types control a myriad of signalling pathways in cells 
* Some mechanisms are similar, some are different

# Reasons for evolution of different mechanisms 
Speculation

* Due to structural divergence between the small G and heterotrimeric G proteins, activation mechanism also had to be differentiated 
* Reduce cross-talk between the two pathways so that there is some independence at the activation step (though cross-talk does occur in later parts of the pathway) 
* Different functions 

# Conclusion 
* Both small G proteins and heterotrimerics exhibit some similarity, but there are many differences 
* Both G proteins show great diversity in the mechanisms of signalling and functions 
* Integrate signals 
* Highly important in the cell
    * Targets of drug discovery campaigns e.g. Ras 
* Exemplars of structure-function relationships
