**How do you think cancer will be treated in 10 years' time?**

# Introduction
- Cancer is an evolutionary arms race 
- Traditional treatments have poor therapeutic indices and often result in relapse – surgery, chemo, radiotherapy 
- Newer generations of treatments are targeted, personalised, and holistic.

# WGS and personalised medicine 
- To address heterogeneity of cancers 
- Order of mutations
- Identify driver mutations for targeting 
- ML + AI 
- e-toe hold
- Liquid biopsies
- Personal tumour organoids 

# Combatting resistance
- Evolutionary robust strategies
- Combination therapies 
- Target resistance mechanisms 

# TME 
- Immunotherapy 
- CAFs, SASP 
- Metastasis treatments 
- Also acknowledgement that we can't just KO what the cancer is doing, but more of normalise it? e.g. for angiogenesis, stiffness of ECM 

# Targeted treatments 
- Small molecule drugs 
- Antibody therapy
- Synthetic lethality 
- RNA drugs e.g. vaccines, siRNAs 

# Generation of new targets 
- Ras G12C 
- Fragment-based drug design using structural biology

# Enabling techniques 
- NGS
- De novo DNA/RNA synthesis 
- AI 
- Structural biology – fragment-based drug screening, Rational drug design e.g. imatinib 
- Synthetic biology 
- Increasing SCALE
