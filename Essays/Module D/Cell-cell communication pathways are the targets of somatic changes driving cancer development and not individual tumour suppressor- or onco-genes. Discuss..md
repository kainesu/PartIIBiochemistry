**Cell-cell communication pathways are the targets of somatic changes driving cancer development and not individual tumour suppressor- or onco-genes. Discuss.**

# **Introduction** 
* Somatic cell theory and the idea of driver mutations are widely accepted across the field of cancer biology. Mutations arise in a single epithelial cell of origin, which then proliferates to form a tumour. 
* However, cancers are highly heterogeneous, and driver mutations that may be important in one patient may not be the same in another. 
* Moreover, there have been cases where cancer development is driven by abnormal cell-cell communication pathways rather than individual tumour suppressor or oncogenes. 
    * E.g. When a malignant cell is implanted among normal tissue, it also becomes normal
        * E.g. Kulesa et al (2006) transplanted adult human metastatic melanoma cells into host chick premigratory neural crest. The melanoma cells did not form tumours, but instead migrated into the surrounding tissue in a neural crest-cell like manner, and also developed morphology resembling neural crest cells. This suggested that the tumour microenvironment can reprogram the phenotype of a cancer 
        * E.g. “Maffini et al. separately exposed mammary stroma and normal mammary epithelial cells to a rapidly metabolized chemical carcinogen and to vehicle, and recombined these tissues to test which combination resulted in mammary carcinomas. The recombination of carcinoma exposed stroma with vehicle-exposed epithelium resulted in neoplasms” 
* Here, I argue that altered cell-cell communication pathways are necessary for the development of cancer, being a phenotype that is selected for during clonal evolution. However, individual tumour suppressor or oncogenes that only affect a cell’s intrinsic regulatory mechanisms are also important to cancer development. 

# **Cell-cell communication pathways more important **

* Changes cell-cell communication pathways drives cancer development by releasing the tumour cell from inhibitory growth signals and promoting a pro-growth tumour microenvironment 
    * Extrinsic hallmarks of cancer 
        * Altered signalling to CAFs → hypoxia, stroma development, angiogenesis 
        * Altered signalling to immune cells (e.g. hiding of MHC) → immune evasion 
        * Cancer exosomes → communication with more distant sites in the body, could facilitate metastasis 
    * Intrinsic hallmarks 
        * Avoidance of apoptosis external pathway 
* In addition, pathways are more important than the individual genes as mutations in different genes can result in the same effect on a cell-cell communication pathway. Cancer development is an evolutionary process; There is no specific “targeting” of particular genes by the cancer (it is not a conscious/intelligent decision). Natural selection acts at the level of the phenotype, not the genotype, so any mutation that can result in a favourable phenotype would be selected for. 
    * Cancers that arise in different tissues all show altered cell-cell communication pathways, yet arrive at this phenotype via driver mutations in different genes 
    * E.g. MAPK pathway, RTK is activated by an external growth factor that leads to a signalling cascade. However, mutation in any part of the pathway could upregulate proliferation in the cell. EGFR, Ras, BRAF and MEK have all been reported to be mutated in different cancers, with their relative frequency among patients varying depending on the tissue of origin (Burotto et al 2014). 
    * E.g. “​​many tumors exhibit either a p53 mutation or MDM2 and MDMX amplification”.  Yu et al (2014) analysed “samples of infiltrating ductal breast carcinoma, overexpression of MDM2 or MDMX was observed in more than half of cases, but was rarely present in the samples with p53 dysfunction” 
    * There is even the case where cell-cell communication pathways could be altered without individual genes being mutated. 
        * Adaptive rewiring in MAPK pathway – BRAF 
    * Evolution of drug resistance to recapitulate a phenotype show that the same cell-cell communication pathway can be altered in different ways 
* An individual tumour suppressor or oncogene is also not sufficient to drive cancer development on its own 
    * E.g. Myc on its own not sufficient to drive cancer development – oncogene cooperation 

# **Individual genes are important too**

* However, time and again we have also seen that certain genes are frequently implicated in the development of many kinds of cancers, e.g. p53, Myc, Ras 
    * Oncogene nodes 
    * Some individual genes, once mutated, are sufficient for the development of certain cancer hallmarks 
* In addition, cell-cell communication pathways alterations is not the only requirement for cancer development. Cancers also possess many mutations that affect cell intrinsic hallmarks e.g. p53, BRCA 

# **Conclusion**
* Use of this knowledge for cancer therapeutics 
    * Because it is pathways that are more important, and not genes, it has been difficult to find a panacea to cancer. Cancers are able to evolve many different ways of achieving the same hallmarks, making them highly heterogeneous 
    * At the same time, given the importance of cell-cell communication, finding ways to disrupt this communication in a way that is robust to evolution could be a viable strategy for many cancers 
* Relative importance of either may change throughout the lifetime of the tumour
