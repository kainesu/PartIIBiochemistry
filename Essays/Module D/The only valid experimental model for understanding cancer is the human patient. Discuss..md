**The only valid experimental model for understanding cancer is the human patient. Discuss.**

# Using humans 
- Not ethical 
- Last step – clinical trials 

# Validity of other models
- Can model cell-intrinsic, fundamental molecular processes okay 
	- Simpler systems are needed to gain mechanistic insights 
	- Tractability of other models to genetic modification makes it easier to study these mechanisms 
	- Yeast 
- Cell extrinsic 
	- CSC in mice
	- Studying metastasis in mice, *Drosophila*
- Are models representative of humans?
	- Many drugs that appear to work in pre-clinical trials end up failing in clinical trials
