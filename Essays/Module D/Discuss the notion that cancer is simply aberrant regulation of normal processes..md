**Discuss the notion that cancer is simply aberrant regulation of normal processes.**

What is aberrant? 

What is normal? = processes that can be found in non-tumour cells of the same cell type 

# Yes, it is aberrant 
Yes, in some ways cancer could be seen as an aberrant regulation of normal processes. Various hallmarks of cancer might be explained as an alteration in the regulation of cellular processes that maintain homeostasis and proliferation within a multicellular environment. 

* Many of the genes that have been implicated in cancer also have roles in a non-cancer cell, and are highly conserved across the tree of life 
    * E.g. p53 
    * E.g. Myc 
* Tumour-stroma phenotype resembles regeneration phenotypes
    * E.g. Sodir et al (2020) showed that in Myc-driven pancreatic adenocarcinoma in mice, there is a lot of phenotypic similarity between PDAC and a regenerating pancreas following injury 
* Deregulation of proliferation 
    * Overexpression / hyperactivity of pro-growth signalling pathways 
* Deregulation of apoptotic pathways 
* Deregulation of immune signalling 
* Deregulation of the differentiated state 
    * Metastasis 
    * miRNA suppression 
* In fact, this idea that cancer is just an aberrant regulation of normal processes has been a fundamental idea behind some cancer therapeutic strategies that target the tumour microenvironment 
    * E.g. Normalisation of angiogenesis 
    * E.g. normalisation of the surrounding cells – transplantation of tumour cells into a non-tumourigenic environment 
    * E.g. promoting cooperation between cells to reinforce multicellularity 
    * If the regulation can be restored, even if the tumour cells contain lesions, then cancer growth can be stopped. 

# But normal processes occurring too 
## Recruitment of non-malignant cells 
However, in some ways normal processes that are being regulated as they should be have also been exploited by tumour cells during cancer development. 

* These cells, in the process of carrying out their regular functions, inadvertently are exploited by the tumour cells. It’s more of a “misuse” rather than a breakdown. 
* Recruitment of cancer-associated fibroblasts (CAFs) 
* Recruitment of tumour-associated macrophages (TAMs)

## Ectopic expression of normal processes
Also in some ways, tumour cells are acquiring phenotypic characteristics of other “normal” cells in an organism, it’s just that these characteristics are ectopic. 
* E.g. avoidance of replicative senescence -> stem cells 

## Obscures cause of deregulation 

Additionally, to say that cancer is just a deregulation of normal processes obscures what the causes of the deregulation are, which can often be spontaneous or inherited. Deregulation of normal processes in cancer can themselves be due to errors in cellular regulation, which are inevitable in any molecular process. However, many cancers are also attributed to spontaneous or inherited mutations/lesions, and this becomes the trigger for deregulation. Changes in the tumour microenvironment can equally be  spontaneous, resulting in aberrant regulation of cell-environment interactions. 

Implications for clinical translation.
