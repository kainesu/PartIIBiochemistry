**What is the best cancer target and why: the tumour cells or their microenvironment?**

# Introduction 
* Increasing evidence that the tumour microenvironment is also important to cancer development 
* Drug-based therapies have traditionally focused on inhibiting specific mutations within tumour cells 
* There has been more focus recently on therapies that might target the microenvironment, such as angiogenesis inhibitors and immunotherapy 
* In the clinic, a decision has to be made on what the most efficacious treatment for the patient is. Often the answer depends on the particular tumour, as the tumour microenvironment and the tumour cells themselves may contribute to tumour development to different extents 
    * Factors that affect the relative extent of each contribution include the stage of the cancer, the tissue of origin of the cancer, and the genotype of the tumour. 
* Apart from the nature of the cancer, the patient’s health and the accessibility of the treatment have to be considered. 
* In this essay, I will discuss the advantages and disadvantages of targeting either the tumour cell or the microenvironment, noting in what contexts either would be most effective. 

# **1. Targeting the tumour cells**

Examples: radiotherapy, chemotherapy, small drug therapeutics (targeted), antibody therapy (some) 

## Advantages 

* Some mutations are repeatedly found across many cancers, so targeting these mutations in tumour cells can be an effective general strategy for treating cancer  
* Targeting tumour cells can be particularly effective if the cancer could be caught early enough that the tumour is mostly homogenous and there is a common, druggable target among all the tumour cells present 
* Therapeutic index can be high particularly for targeted drug therapeutics
    * E.g. synthetic lethality 
    * E.g. 
* Cheaper and more accessible; small drugs can be produced _en masse_ in the way that e.g. immunotherapies cannot. 
* In terms of developing new therapies, targeting tumour cells could be easier than targeting the tumour microenvironment; it is more straightforward to inhibit a known driver mutation, than to figure out how to modify the tumour microenvironment. TME is complex and can be pro or anti-tumourigenic. 

## Disadvantages

* Evolution of drug resistance. 
    * E.g. Androgen deprivation therapies have been used to treat prostate cancer. Prostate tumours rely on androgen receptor-mediated signalling, and drugs that inhibit androgen secretion by the testes can be used to prevent prostate tumour growth. However, the prostate tumour cells can evolve resistance to this treatment via several mechanisms, such as genomic amplification of _AR_ locus, _AR_ mutations or using _AR_ splice variants. This compensates for the reduced androgen by increasing cell sensitivity to androgen. 
    * Minimal residual disease
* Some treatments could result in the creation of a protumourigenic microenvironment
    * E.g. Gilbert et al (2010) – treatment of animal model with chemotherapy drug, doxorubicin, resulted in endothelial cells producing interluekin-6 (IL-6) and tissue inhibitor of metalloproteinase 1 (TIMP-1), which made the thymus a sanctuary for tumour cells  
* Delivery can be an issue particularly in dense stroma 
* You need a targetable marker or driver mutation, but this may not be the case for all cancers, especially as WGS is not available to all patients yet e.g. triple negative breast cancer lacks the receptors normally found in breast cancers (estrogen, progesterone, HER2 receptors) and that are usually exploited for treatment of the cancer 
* What if there are many drivers in the cancer? If we target too many drivers with multiple drugs, might the treatment be too toxic for the patient? 

# **2. Targeting the tumour microenvironment**        

Examples: angiogenesis inhibitors, immunotherapy, surgical resection (!), hypoxia inhibitors                                 

## Advantages             

* Targeting the tumour microenvironment could be effective if the tumour is highly heterogenous. This is because with genetically heterogenous tumours, it is difficult to find a gene target that would affect all cancer cells. On the other hand, the tumour microenvironment can affect multiple subclones, increasing its efficacy 
* Targeting the tumour microenvironment can also be helpful in preventing relapse of a tumour after the primary tumour has been removed. After surgical resection or drug treatment of the primary tumour mass, the tumour microenvironment could be modified to prevent any remaining cancer cells from re-establishing in the niche or in other niches (i.e metastasis) 
* Hot tumours may respond better to immunotherapies than cold tumours. 
    * E.g. melanomas 
* Targeting the tumour microenvironment could also potentially be robust to evolution of therapeutic resistance 
    * Stromal cells are not genetically unstable, and are less likely to evolve resistance to the therapeutic, particularly if the therapeutic does not affect the fitness of the stromal cells. 
        * E.g. Qiu et al (2008) – did not find somatic mutations in CAFs in breast, ovarian cancers  
        * E.g. In anti-VEGFA clinicial trials, patients were treated with chemotherapy and a VEGFA inhibitor. Some patients developed treatment resistance and their cancer progressed, so they were then treated with a second line of chemotherapy and the same VEGFA inhibitor. VEGFA addition improved survival of the patients, suggesting that the initial progression was not due to VEGFA resistance 
            * Giantonio et al (2007) 
    * Immunoediting 
* Some tumours are resistant to targeting due to the TME 
    * Growth factor-conferred resistance
        * E.g. Stromal-derived hepatocyte growth factor can confer resistance to BRAF(V600E) inhibition and Her2 inhibition 
        * E.g. WNT-16b secreted by normal human fibroblasts can confer resistance; depletion of WNT-16b improved response to chemotherapy 
        * Sun et al (2012) 
    * Improving drug delivery – tumour vasculature can be restricted by the ECM, preventing blood flow and thus accessibility of therapeutics to the tumour interior 
        * E.g. in an animal model of pancreatic cancer, depleting hyaluronan from the tumour microenvironment improved efficacy of chemotherapy 
            * Provenzano et al (2012) 

## Disadvantages 

* Some just not effective, e.g. angiogenesis inhibitors, hypoxia inhibition 
* Targeting the tumour microenvironment is only helpful if there is a protumourigenic environment for targeting. For smaller tumours, the microenvironment may not play an important enough role in the survival of the cancer, e.g. angiogenesis would not be a critical need of the tumour. Some tumours of certain tissue-of-origin would also not be as reliant on TME, e.g. …. 
* Some available TME treatments are expensive – e.g. Immunotherapy can cost millions of dollars. 
* TME therapies may have systemic side effects on the patient since they target non-malignant cells that have normal functions in the patient
    * E.g. cytokine storm resulting from immunotherapy 
* TME therapies may have unintended side effects due to incomplete understanding; 
    * E.g. NSCLC patients administered with VEGF inhibitors had decreased delivery of radio-labelled chemotherapy monitored by positron emission tomography (PET). The patients benefited from the combination but unclear why delivery was decreased, or why they benefited if indeed delivery was reduced 
* Still difficult to determine the composition of stroma in human tumours correctly
* Tumours can also acquire resistance to TME therapy 

# **Conclusion **                                                                 
* Combination therapies – e.g. targeted + immunotherapy 
* Treatment has to be adaptive as cancers are evolving diseases; whether tumour cells or their microenvironment is the better target can change throughout the progression of the cancer
