**What determines whether or not mammalian cells proliferate and whether they live or die?**

# Introduction 
- Unlike prokaryotes, cell proliferation and death in metazoan cells are social context-dependent.
- Decisions are determined by a process I term "threshold crossing". Multiple signals are integrated by sensors/nodes, and if the total amount of signalling crosses a particular threshold, the cell commits to the decision of proliferating/senescence, or living/apoptosis. 

# Decision to proliferate

- For most somatic cells, the cell cycle inherently inhibited via various mechanisms: 
- Contact inhibition
	- Hippo pathway restriction of the growth for cells autonomously (contact inhibition)
- Proliferation can be activated by mitogenic signals received from surrounding cells, loss of contact inhibition, etc. --> mitogenic signalling is a social phenomenon
- Signals are received by extracellular receptors that cascade through multiple pathways.
- Signals are integrated at nodes, namely Myc. 
	- Myc makes the decision whether to proliferate and upregulates pro-proliferative pathways e.g. cyclin-Cdks, biosynthesis (via mTOR), and inhibiting apoptosis (via PI3K) 

# Decision to live 
- Necrosis = accidental, acute death
- Apoptosis = programmed death
	- Extrinsic
		- Default state = death for immune cells. Need constant supply of survival factor, otherwise die of neglect
		- Fas-induced cell death, in immune surveillance
	- Intrinsic
		- p53 -> -> puma -> Bax/Bac 
	- Cell integrates pro-and anti-apoptotic signals at sensor(s), e.g. p53

# Conclusion 
- Central nodes, integrate signalling
- Cancer = hacked version of this programme
