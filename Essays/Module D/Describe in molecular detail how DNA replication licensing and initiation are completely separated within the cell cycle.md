**Describe in molecular detail how DNA replication licensing and initiation are completely separated within the cell cycle.**

# Introduction 
- Eukaryotic system – bacterial DNA replication licensing is not specifically separated from initiation. 
- Licensing = loading of MCM2-7 

# Main 
S-CDK is the key toggle switch that separates licensing and initiation. When S-CDK activity is high, it inhibits licensing and promotes replication initiation.

1. How S-CDK promotes initiation 
2. How S-CDK inhibits licensing 
3. How the activity of S-CDK is regulated to ensure alternation of initiation and licensing
