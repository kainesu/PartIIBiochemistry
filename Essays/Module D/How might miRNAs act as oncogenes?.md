**How might miRNAs act as oncogenes?**

# **Introduction**

Cancer is a complex and heterogeneous disease that might be initiated via the dysregulation of any number of mechanisms. It is perhaps unsurprising then that the aberrant expression of miRNAs may also drive cancer progression. Although miRNAs are rather homogenous in their modes of action compared to the diverse number of signalling proteins and enzymes that have been implicated in cancer, the existence of miRNAs that target virtually every signalling pathway in the cell makes them potent actors in cancer. As with proteins, miRNAs can act as both tumour suppressors and oncogenes, but this essay will focus on their role as the latter. Typically, oncogenes are defined as a protein that is overexpressed or hyperactive that leads to a tumour. These oncogenes often arise from “gain-of-function” mutations in proto-oncogenes. In a similar way, miRNAs can become overexpressed, suppressing the translation of genes to facilitate cancer progression. miRNAs have been implicated in various signalling pathways, but here I concentrate on their roles in suppressing tumour suppressor genes and in promoting a tumourigenic microenvironment. 

# **1. Mode of action of oncogenic miRNAs**

Oncogenic miRNAs are typically upregulated in one of three ways. Firstly, they may undergo genetic amplification, which increases their copy number and thus increases the number of transcripts that are synthesised. For example, Zhang et al (2006) used comparative genomic hybridisation to determine the copy number of 283 miRNA genes in various epithelial cancer samples. They found 26 miRNA genes that underwent a gain in copy number, including those that have oncogenic effects. One miRNA, mir-9-1, was predicted to target the _HES1_ gene, which is a tumour suppressor gene. The study also showed via RT-qPCR that the change in copy number is positively correlated with changes in transcription. As such, an increase in copy number of oncogenic miRNAs in tumours can lead to their overexpression. 

Oncogenic miRNAs may also become overexpressed via the action of regulatory proteins and proteins involved in their biogenesis. For example, Myc is known to upregulate the miR-17/92 cluster which has been implicated in cancer. The enzymes involved in miRNA processing have also been shown to be upregulated in some tumours, with Zhang et al (2006) discovering gene amplification of _Dicer1_ and _Argonaute_2 in ovarian tumours. This could increase the rate at which miRNA is produced from pri-miRNA, thus leading to overexpression. 

Lastly, miRNAs may become overexpressed if they lose repressive epigenetic marks. In non-malignant cells, the expression of proto-oncogene miRNA can be controlled by epigenetic marks that cause condensation of the chromatin, reducing the accessibility of the promoter to RNA polymerase for transcription. This often involves methylation on specific histone residues, which recruits chromatin remodelers to condense the chromatin.  In the case of lung adenocarcinomas, let-7a-3 has been found to be hypomethylated, resulting in increased expression. This promotes tumorigenesis as let-7a-3a affects genes involved in cell proliferation, adhesion, and differentiation. 

Once miRNAs are upregulated, how do they exert their effects on cell signalling pathways? miRNAs all have a common mode of action, which involves acting as a guide RNA for the RNA-induced silencing complex (RISC). RISC binds to target RNA which have imperfect complementarity to the miRNA guide. miRNA binding sites are usually found within the 3’ UTR of the gene. This induces repression of translation initiation, as well as recruitment of canonical RNA decay factors, thus leading to downregulation of translation. Despite this common mode of action, depending on the exact target gene, miRNAs can play different regulatory functions, which are explored below.

# **2. miRNAs promote increased proliferation and apoptotic resistance **

As miRNAs can directly downregulate the translation of genes, many oncogenic miRNAs expectedly target tumour suppressor gene transcripts directly. In fact, miRNAs can target genes at multiple layers within a tumour suppressor signalling pathway. For example, in the pRB pathway, The 3’ UTR gene of pRB contains binding sites for miR-106a, which is overexpressed in a variety of human cancers. As pRB sequesters E2F, which acts as a transcriptional activator of genes involved in S phase progression, downregulation of pRB by miR-106a leads to increased E2F expression and thus allowing for cell cycle progression and cell proliferation. The miR-17/92 cluster is also involved, as one of its members (miR-20a) targets E2F for downregulation. The action of miR-20a does not appear to be oncogenic at first given that downregulation of E2F should oppose cell cycle progression. However, it has also been shown that E2Fs directly activate transcription of the miR-17/92 cluster by binding to its promoter. This suggests that there is a negative feedback loop between E2F and miR-17/92. Via mathematical modelling, one study proposed that this negative feedback loop helps to keep E2F levels low enough to prevent apoptosis via intrinsic tumour suppression. At the same time, the level of signalling is still high enough that the cell cycle progresses faster than normal. In this way, miR-20a could be seen as oncogenic, even though at face value it appears to downregulate the expression of another oncogene.

miRNAs can also prevent the intrinsic tumour suppression pathway that many cells have built in to limit the activity of oncogenes. For example, excessive Myc activity usually leads to apoptosis as this activates an apoptotic inducer, Bim. In cancer, the miR-17/92 cluster can be upregulated by Myc, and this cluster targets Bim for translational downregulation, thus blocking it from inducing apoptosis. This allows Myc to continue to be overexpressed, increasing the proliferation rate of the cell while also increasing its chance of survival. As Myc also upregulates expression miR-20a which targets E2F, it appears that the function of the miR-17/92 cluster could be to increase the safe limit of E2F signalling (by downregulating apoptotic inducers), while also continuing to keep the level of signalling below the limit. This exemplifies how oncogenic miRNAs may exhibit complex interactions oncogenic pathways and tumour suppressor pathways, the sum of which leads to increased proliferation and survival overall. 

The downregulation of certain tumour suppressor genes by miRNAs can lead to oncogenic addiction, where inhibition of the miRNA leads to cell death. For example, the Slack lab created a mouse model where miR-155 could be controlled using a Tet expression system. Aberrant expression of this miRNA alone can cause cancer, as it targets SOCS3, a negative regulator of the JAK-STAT signalling pathway. In this way, miR-155 indirectly upregulates the JAK-STAT pathway to promote proliferation. The lab found that in mice with disseminated lymphoma, the tumours regress when miR-155 expression is turned off upon doxycycline withdrawal, suggesting that the cancer cells are dependent on the continued expression of miR-155. Thus, miRNAs can share the trait of oncogene addiction with other conventional oncogenes, such as Myc. 

# **3. miRNAs promote cell extrinsic hallmarks of cancer**

The tumour microenvironment is also important to cancer progression, as non-malignant cells can be recruited by the tumour to facilitate its growth and survival. For example, some miRNAs are known to promote angiogenesis, which increases the nutrients and oxygen available to cancer cells and thus allows for increased growth. One miRNA, miR-126, targets Spred-1 for translation downregulation. Spred-1 is an inhibitor of vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) and fibroblast growth factor (FGF), which promote the growth and differentiation of endothelial cells, thus allowing for angiogenesis. By reducing inhibition of VEGF and FGF, these growth factors are able to promote angiogenesis around the tumour, thus promoting tumour growth. 

miRNAs can also increase the metastatic potential of cancer cells, increasing their ability to establish themselves in secondary sites. One way they have been shown to do this is by promoting the epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition. The EMT is a conserved developmental programme that involves changes in multiple gene expression programmes, resulting in an epithelial cell becoming more mesenchymal-like. It is a key step in a cancer cell becoming metastatic, and in EMT the cell acquires the ability to break through basal membranes so that it can migrate to other parts of the body. Some miRNAs can exert a more global effect on EMT gene expression. For example, miR-101 inhibits expression of EZH2, a histone methyltransferase that silences genes involved in EMT, such as integrin β1, which indirectly activates TGFβ signalling.

miRNAs can also target more specific steps during EMT. During EMT, E-cadherin expression is downregulated, while N-cadherin expression is upregulated in a step known as the cadherin switch. miR-9 inhibits translation of E-cadherin, and miR-199 and 218 are predicted to be regulators of N-cadherin, though this has not been experimentally confirmed. As such, miRNAs promote detachment of the cancer cell from the surrounding ECM, and promote metastasis. In addition, miRNAs also promote the loss of tight junctions, which is needed to organise epithelial tissues, thus promoting EMT. One miRNA, miR-491-5p, is upregulated by TGFβ signalling, which is also often upregulated in cancer. miR-491-5p inhibits the translation of Par-3, a protein involved in the formation of tight junctions. Zhou et al (2010) used a luciferase reporter assay to demonstrate that miR-491-5p directly downregulates Par-3 by targeting binding sites in the 3’ UTR, primarily by inducing mRNA decay. Hence, by promoting EMT at multiple steps of signalling, oncogenic miRNAs can increase the metastatic potential of the cancer cell.

# **Conclusion** 

miRNA can act as oncogenes by upregulating cell proliferation, preventing apoptosis, and promoting metastasis, among numerous mechanisms that could not all be discussed in this essay. They are upregulated in very similar ways to conventional proto-oncogenes. Despite using similar modes of action, miRNAs have been able to target diverse signalling pathways, and this targeting information is encoded in the variety of nucleotide sequences in miRNAs. The knowledge of miRNA involvement in cancer can be useful in various clinical applications. New therapeutics could be developed that target oncogenic miRNAs, such as “antimirs” which are antisense oligomers. The detection of miRNAs might also be used as a diagnostic or prognostic tool, as they are often found in circulation. The level of oncogenic miRNAs in the blood could thus be used as a non-invasive biomarker of cancer. In the future, more work might be done on understanding how miRNA expression changes depending on the context of the tumour (e.g. tissue type, in metastatic tissue, expression pattern of other genes, etc.). It would also be important to understand the relative contribution of different miRNAs to cancer development compared to conventional oncogenes, thus identifying the most promising targets for therapy.
