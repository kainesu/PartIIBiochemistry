**Why is cancer so difficult to cure?**

# Therapeutic index 
- It is difficult to distinguish tumour cells from normal cells 
- Early treatments – chemo, radiotherapy also would target normal cells that rapidly proliferate as part of their normal function 
- Metastatic drugs also have poor therapeutic index 

# Heterogeneity 
- No general treatment for cancer
- No two tumours are alike – each can have different driver mutations, requiring different targeted drug therapies 
- The tumour microenvironment influences cancer development, and this is also heterogenous between patients 
	- Tumour microenvironment often resembles tissue regeneration 
	- Hot vs cold tumour -> choice of immune therapy 
	- Developed stroma can block delivery of larger drugs 
- Personalised medicine is a popular idea, but economies of scale affect cost 
- WGS would help but not fully rolled out 

# Evolution and plasticity 
- Cancer development is a process of clonal evolution 
- Drug resistance 
- Immunoediting 
- Metastasis 
- Therapies are not sufficiently evolutionarily robust. 
- Subclonal diversity 

# Some aspects of cancer are difficult to study 
- Paracrine signalling 
- Extrinsic hallmarks 
- Metastasis -> relapse 
- Early cancer development. 
- If it is difficult to study, then we do not have sufficient knowledge of the mechanisms to target it therapeutically 
- E.g. failure of angiogenesis drugs 
- Model systems that are usually used to test therapeutics often fail in clinical trials
