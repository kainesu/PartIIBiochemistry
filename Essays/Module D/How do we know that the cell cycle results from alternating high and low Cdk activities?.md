**How do we know that the cell cycle results from alternating high and low Cdk activities?**

# Introduction 
The cell cycle describes the chronological sequence of molecular activities within a cell that progresses it through growth and proliferation. During this sequence, cells alternate between phases of DNA replication and chromosome segregation, and the timing of each phase must be tightly regulated to avoid DNA damage. This task is primarily accomplished by cyclin-dependent kinases (Cdks), whose activity oscillates between high and low throughout the cell cycle. These Cdks phosphorylate a plethora of substrates which then directly implement the activities associated with each phase of the cell cycle. However, there have been opposing ideas on which Cdk activities are needed to drive each phase of the cell cycle. Historically, multiple lines of evidence led to the development of the _classical model_ of the cell cycle, whereby each phase of the cell cycle is initiated by the rising activity of unique Cdk-cyclin complexes, which then fall towards the end of the phase. However, more recent studies suggest a _minimal model_ where the alternation in activities of just 1 or 2 Cdk-cyclin complexes is essential to the cell cycle. In this essay, I discuss the evidence for each model to show the different ways in which alternating high and low Cdk activity can result in the phases of the cell cycle. Ultimately, the most accurate model may be a hybrid of both and is cell-type dependent. 

# Cdk activity alternates between high and low due to cyclic changes in the level of cyclins**

Cyclins have been shown to go through cycles of degradation and re-synthesis. Pioneering experiments in sea urchin oocytes demonstrated this cycling. For example, Hunt (1983) incubated fertilised eggs with <sup>35</sup>S-Met to label newly synthesised proteins. Cell lysates were sampled at set intervals to analyse changes in protein levels over the course of the cell cycle via a time resolved Western blot. It was found that cyclins disappeared abruptly at the end of each mitosis, and gradually reappeared in the next interphase. 

This oscillation in cyclin levels is what leads to the oscillations in Cdk activity, as Cdks are only active when bound to cyclin. Cyclins bind to an extensive region of the Cdks, which pulls the T loop out of the substrate binding cleft, thus allowing Cdk to bind to their substrates. In the absence of cyclin, Cdks bind ATP such that it cannot be hydrolysed, preventing substrate binding.

# Biochemical experiments suggest that alternating activities of different Cdk-cyclin complexes drives the cell cycle **

Under the classical model, different CDK-cyclin complexes sequentially become active and inactive, and this causes the cell to alternate between cell cycle phases (Figure 1). This is because each cyclin was thought to confer specificity for different substrates that drive each phase of the cell cycle. Yeast cell cycles are controlled by a single Cdk that is bound to different cyclins. In mammals, different Cdks bind to different cyclins throughout the cell cycle to regulate phase entry, maintenance and exit. Each Cdk-cyclin complex acts sequentially, rising in level to trigger a unique set of events then falling so that the cell can move to the next phase of the cell cycle.

This classical model was developed from biochemical work done in the 1990s that studied how the changes in levels of different cyclins corresponded to different cell cycle phases, and how they interact with different Cdks to bring about each phase. For example, Pines & Hunter (1989 & 1990) monitored the changes in cyclin A and B mRNA levels throughout the human cell cycle via Northern blot. They verified that this corresponded to cyclical changes in protein level via immunoblotting against cyclin A and B. It was further shown that cyclin A and B co-immunoprecipitated with Cdks – cyclin B appeared to interact with cdc2 in the G2 phase, while cyclin A interacts with an apparent kinase to form a complex that gradually increases from S to G2 phase. This and similar studies provided evidence that Cdk activity could be regulated cyclically by changes in cyclin activity throughout the cell cycle, creating a basis for cell cycle regulation. 

A more direct link between oscillating Cdk activity and cell cycle regulation was reported by Fang and Newport (1991). In this study, two cdc2 homologs, cdk2 and cdc2, were depleted separately from _Xenopus_ egg extracts via pull-down using anti-cdk2 or anti-cdc2, then the effect on DNA replication and mitosis was observed. As depletion of cdk2 inhibited DNA replication and depletion of cdc2 inhibited mitosis, the authors concluded that G1-S and G2-M transitions are each controlled by cdk2 and cdc2 respectively. In addition, they assayed the kinase activity of each protein during different phases of the cell cycle, and found that cdk2 activity oscillates and peaks during mitosis. Overall, the study showed that Cdk activities alternate during the cell cycle, and their activity is linked to different cell cycle phases. Combining the information gained from these studies created a picture of the cell cycle that was controlled by multiple Cdk-cyclin complexes that oscillate sequentially over the course of the cycle. 

# Experiments in fission yeast suggest that the alternating activity of a single Cdk-cyclin complex can result in the cell cycle **

In the minimal model, Cdks are not functionally specialised and exhibit overlap in their substrate specificities. Rather, the total level of Cdk activity is what orders cell cycle events regardless of the source of the activity. In this case, each cell cycle phase is triggered once the total Cdk activity crosses a particular threshold (Figure 2). In this case, the Cdk alternates between low, intermediate and high activity, and this alternates the cell cycle between G1, S and M phases respectively.

In yeast, cell cycle progression is normally controlled by a single Cdk (cdc28 in _Saccharomyces cerevisiae_ or cdc2 in _S. pombe_) that bind to specific cyclins at different stages of the cell cycle. However, in _S. pombe_, a single B-type cyclin (cdc13) was found to be sufficient to drive both S and M phases. Coudreuse & Nurse (2010) took advantage of this to create a cdc13-cdc2 fusion protein containing a mutant form of cdc2 that is analog-sensitive. This allowed for the activity of the Cdk to be modulated with varying concentrations of a competitive inhibitor. The study found that at low concentrations of inhibitor, mitosis was blocked, while DNA replication was unaffected. On the other hand, at higher concentrations of inhibitor, both mitosis and DNA replication were inhibited. These results suggest that a high level of cdc2 activity is needed to drive mitosis while only a lower level is needed for DNA replication. Hence, the experiment showed that alternation of cdc2 activity alone between low and high leads to alternation between S and M phase respectively. 

This model of cell cycle control could be explained by differences in affinity of the Cdk for S phase-linked substrates and M phase-linked substrates. Swaffer et al (2016) similarly used an analog-sensitive Cdc13-Cdc2 fusion protein to control Cdk activity, then used mass spectrometry to measure changes in the phosphorylation state of Cdk substrates across the range of Cdk activity. They found that early substrates involved in DNA replication  are phosphorylated at lower levels of Cdk activity than late substrates involved in mitosis, suggesting that they have higher affinity for Cdk. This study provides further mechanistic support for how alternating Cdk activities result in the cell cycle. Rather than having different Cdks phosphorylate different substrates in each phase, the same Cdk can phosphorylate different substrates depending on its total level of activity in the cell. 

Alternation of Cdk activities in mammalian cells may also follow a similar principle. Santamaria et al (2007) demonstrated that most cell types from mice deficient of CDK2, 4 and 6 were able to complete the cell cycle, while only cells from Cdk1 KO mice could not. This suggests that the mammalian cell cycle could also function on a minimal model, although further experiments similar to those done by the Nurse group would be needed to confirm this. 

# **4. Conclusion **

The evidence presented in this essay generally agrees that Cdk activity alternates between low and high during the cell cycle to trigger molecular events. The point of contention lies in which Cdks are needed for cell cycle progression. More recent evidence, such as from Basu et al (2022), may point to a hybrid model where each model contributes to cell cycle progression to different extents. The model of Cdk control may also be cell-type dependent – some specialised cell types, such as pancreatic beta cells and pituitary lactotrophs, require multiple Cdk-cyclin complexes to complete their cell cycle. This understanding of how alternating Cdk activities regulate the cell cycle will have important clinical implications, including research on how cancer arises from cell cycle dysfunction or the development of Cdk inhibitors as therapeutics.

**Could usefully have added that DNA replication origins can only be licensed when CDK activity is low, and that increasing CDK activity prevents licensing and fires origins.** -> link Cdk activity to key events in the cell cycle!
