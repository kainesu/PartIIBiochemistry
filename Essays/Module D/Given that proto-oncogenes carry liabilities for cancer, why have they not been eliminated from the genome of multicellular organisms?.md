**Given that proto-oncogenes carry liabilities for cancer, why have they not been eliminated from the genome of multicellular organisms?**

# **Introduction **

* Many proto-oncogenes have been implicated in the development of cancer, a deadly disease 
* Given the deleterious effect of cancer on the fitness of an individual, it may be surprising that these proto-oncogenes have not been eliminated from the genome over the course of evolution  
    * E.g. Ise et al (2000) deleted HRAS in mice and found that these mice were less likely to develop papillomas than wt mice after exposure to a carcinogen
    * Fewer loci that can be mutated → less likely to develop cancer  
* In answering this question, we need to consider the factors that would drive elimination versus conservation of proto-oncogenes, in particular the overall effect on fitness. If the net effect on fitness is positive, proto-oncogenes should be selected for and thus conserved. Otherwise, they will experience negative selection. 
* Fitness = number of offspring, propagative ability 

# Robust tumour suppressor mechanisms mean that proto-oncogenes very infrequently become oncogenic 

* Robust tumour suppressor mechanisms mean that proto-oncogenes very infrequently become oncogenic 
    * Long-lived species that are more likely to develop cancer on the basis of age may have more robust tumour suppressor mechanisms (Peto’s Paradox)
        * E.g. elephants have a higher copy number of p53 than humans
        * E.g. “ In culture, naked mole-rat cells stop dividing at much lower densities than do human and mouse cells due to the early activation of the p16 pathway, which results in hypersensitivity to contact inhibition”
    * Other mechanisms: DNA repair, cell cycle checkpoints, apoptosis, immune surveillance 
    * Intrinsic tumour suppression ensures that proto-oncogenes are not overexpressed or hyperactive 
        * E.g. Myc and p53  
    * For multicellularity to be maintained, “Selfish”/ “cheater” cells have to be suppressed 

# Proto-oncogenes have important normal functions
* Proto-oncogenes also have important normal physiological functions in cells
    * Function of proto-oncogenes have been exapted 
    * Proto-oncogenes involved in cell proliferation, which is needed for growth and regeneration in multicellular organisms 
    * They also have other functions apart from proliferation i.e. pleiotropy (e.g.?) 
    * Loss of proto-oncogenes can also be deleterious, and for that reason, they are conserved
    * For example, (insert stuff that Myc, Ras, ABL, c-JUN, etc. do) 

# Most multicellular organisms do not live long enough 
* Many multicellular organisms may not live long enough to even suffer from cancer, and so cancer is not a strong enough selection pressure such that the cost of eliminating proto-oncogenes from the genome can outweigh the benefit of avoiding cancer 
    * Even in humans, cancer is mostly a disease for the aged, who have often already reproduced or are past their reproductive age. Proto-oncogenes have no deleterious effect on their ability to reproduce, nor on the survival of the offspring. Thus, proto-oncogenes are inherited from generation to generation. 

# **Conclusion
* Flipside of the coin. If tumour suppressor genes are so important to preventing cancer, why are they not upregulated or amplified in all species, like in elephants or blue whales? There is likely to be some hidden fitness cost to it, e.g. use of resources to express tumour suppressor genes that could be used to express other genes
