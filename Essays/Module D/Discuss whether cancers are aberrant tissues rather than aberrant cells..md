**Discuss whether cancers are aberrant tissues rather than aberrant cells.**

# **Introduction** 
* Classically, cancer has been viewed as an unregulated proliferation of cells arising from a single cell that acquired somatic mutations. 
* However, over the past few decades of cancer research, tumours have been found to be much more complex. They have a heterogenous composition of different subclones, and they interact with stromal cells that make up a supportive framework. 
* By framing cancer as a tissue-based disease, the focus is on <span style="text-decoration:underline;">aberrant interactions</span> between tumour cells, as well as between tumour cells and stromal cells. Normal, antiproliferative interactions between tumour cells and non-malignant cells are removed. New, tumour-promoting interactions are then activated. 
* At the same time, it is also undeniable that cells within the tumour are themselves aberrant due to the somatic acquisition of driver mutations in oncogenes and tumour suppressor genes. These mutations can increase the capacity of the individual tumour cell to proliferate independent of its interactions with other cells. 
* Both aberrant cells and aberrant interactions are present in tumours. Is either more important than the other? I propose a mixed model where aberrant cells OR aberrant interactions may act as the initial driver for the cancer. If the cancer starts from aberrant cells, then the tumour must evolve to cut off tumour-restricting interactions and form tumour-promoting ones. Conversely, if the tumour starts from aberrant interactions, then the tumour should evolve an increased capacity for proliferation, otherwise cell-intrinsic tumour suppressor pathways may block cell division. 

# **Yes, cancers are more like aberrant tissues**

## **1. Tumours exhibit division of labour**

* Cancer cells exhibit division of labour 
    * Cancers are heterogeneous – containing different subclonal populations and non-cancerous cells 
    * Reproductive division of labour – cancer stem cell hypothesis 
        * The cancer stem cell hypothesis proposes that there exists a subset of cells within the tumour that have the ability to self-proliferate and differentiate into other tumour cells, while other cells are non-proliferative. These cells are termed “cancer stem cells” or tumour-propagating cells. 
            * E.g. Chen et al (2012) used lineage tracing to identify a subset of tumour cells in a genetically engineered mouse model of glioma. These tumour cells were able to regenerate the tumour after treating the initial tumour with an inhibitor, which only targeted proliferating derivatives that did not self-renew. 
        * This is similar to the hierarchical organisation of tissues, where adult stem cells in different tissues are responsible for regeneration of mature, quiescent cells that are not able to self-renew. For example, mammary stem cells can undergo asymmetric division to produce another mammary stem cell as well as a more differentiated cell, including luminal and myoepithelial cells of the mammary gland. 
        * This reproductive division of labour is a feature of tissues as it is suggestive of cooperation between tumour cells. Derivatives of the tumour-propagating cells are not themselves able to self-renew, so they rely on the tumour-propagating cells to produce more of them. On the other hand, the tumour-propagating cells may rely on their derivatives for other functions such as recruitment of stromal cells or microenvironment modification, which improves their survival and thus fitness. 
        * Sprouffske et al (2012)  showed via computational modeling that if these derivatives increase the fitness of their tumour-propagating progenitors, this would select for the ability for asymmetric division in these progenitors. 
        * At the same time, there is some controversy over the CSC hypothesis, with different studies suggesting varying proportions of CSCs in different cancers. 
    * Even if the relevance of the CSC hypothesis differs among cancers, tumours are also undeniably heterogenous, where different subclonal populations are found within a tumour. These different subclones have often been portrayed as competing, resulting in selection for the subclone with highest fitness. However, as subclones are also closely related, kin selection may result in some level of cooperation between subclonal populations, resulting in _de facto_ division of labour within the tumour. 
        * For example, Cleary et al (2014) sequenced Wnt1 mutant tumours in mouse models of breast cancer to show that some tumours contain genetically distinct basal Hras mutant subclones and luminal Hras wild-type subclones, and both are needed for tumour propagation. This is because the luminal subclone secreted Wnt which supported the growth of the basal subclone. 
        * Other possible examples of division of labour include how some subclones are capable of modifying the tumour microenvironment by vascular growth factors to promote angiogenesis, which benefits other subclones that have not acquired this ability. 
* Hence, this cooperation between tumour cells suggests that tumours may be rather tissue-like. They are aberrant because the cooperation promotes the proliferation of the tumour cells rather than contributing to the benefit of the organism as a whole. 

## **2. Tumour cells interact with stromal cells to promote tumour cell proliferation**

* Cancer is tissue-based because of the reliance of tumours on the environment for their growth and survival. In one model of cancer known as the tissue organisation field theory (TOFT), the default state of cells is to proliferate. However, most cells are in environments that inhibit proliferation, due to the chemical composition of that environment or due to signals received from surrounding cells. Tumour cells may acquire mutations that result in resistance to inhibitory growth signals. 
    * E.g. Loss of E-cadherin 
    * E.g. Maffini et al. separately exposed mammary stroma and normal mammary epithelial cells to a rapidly metabolized chemical carcinogen and to vehicle, and recombined these tissues to test which combination resulted in mammary carcinomas. The recombination of carcinoma exposed stroma with vehicle-exposed epithelium resulted in neoplasms
* Similar to normal tissues, cancer cells can interact with stromal cells, modifying the tumour microenvironment to support their survival and proliferation 
    * Extracellular matrix 
        * Cancer-associated fibroblasts 
    * Angiogenesis 
    * Lymphangiogenesis 
    * Immune evasion 
* The importance of the tumour microenvironment is supported by studies where tumour cells are “normalised” when placed in an environment surrounded by normal tissues. 
    * E.g. Kulesa et al (2006) transplanted adult human metastatic melanoma cells into host chick premigratory neural crest. The melanoma cells did not form tumours, but instead migrated into the surrounding tissue in a neural crest-cell like manner, and also developed morphology resembling neural crest cells. This suggested that the tumour microenvironment can reprogram the phenotype of a cancer 
* Disruption of the microenvironment can also be a driver event independent of mutations within the tumour cells, in what has been termed “niche-induced oncogenesis”. 
    * E.g. Raaijmakers et al (2010) found that deleting _Dicer1_ in mouse stromal osteoprogenitors resulted in bone hematopoietic cells becoming myelodysplastic, i.e. they do not differentiate. This predisposes to acute myeloid leukaemia. When myelodysplastic haematopoietic cells from the mutant mice were transplanted into a wild type mouse, they did not propagate and their morphology was normalised. Conversely, when bone marrow cells from the wt mice were transplanted into the mice with mutant osteoprogenitors, they developed myelodysplasia. This study thus indicated that perturbing stromal cells (osteoprogenitors) in the microenvironment could drive cancer development (AML). 

# Tumours could also be seen as aberrant cells
* In the more classical view of cancer, tumours arise from somatically acquired driver mutations in a cell that promotes its proliferation, resulting in the formation of a tumour. 
* The initial oncogenic hit can drive early tumour formation 
    * E.g. Experiments in genetically engineered mice show that cancer can arise from aberrant cells that have driver mutations 
    * E.g. germline mutations – BRCA mutant patients are predisposed to breast cancer 
* Apart from interactions between tumour cells and between tumour cells and stromal cells, tumour cells also undergo intrinsic changes that are required for their proliferation
    * E.g. re-expression of telomerase to avoid replicative senescence, thus increasing the Hayflick limit of the cell 
    * E.g. increased pro-growth signalling – via Myc 
    * E.g. loss of tumour suppressor mechanisms – p53 mutation 
    * As such, it is insufficient for the cell to be within an aberrant microenvironment, but the cells themselves have to be aberrant too 
* Of course, there is a blurred line here because mutations in cells that result in them becoming aberrant could very well result in aberrant cell-cell interactions

# **Conclusion** 
* There is space for both frames of view on cancer; given how heterogenous cancers are, it would not be surprising that one particular view may be more relevant depending on the stage or type of cancer. 
* However, considering both views could reveal new insights about how to treat cancer 
* Implications for therapy – targeting tumour microenvironment
    * E.g. immunotherapy has been very effective for some cancers e.g. melanoma 
    * Exploit tissue organisation of cancer to develop evolution-resistant therapies 
        * E.g. Adaptive therapy – Change dosage of drugs to promote interclonal competition rather than cooperation. This would involve not using the highest dose tolerable, but rather reduce the dosage so that the selective pressure is not so high as to favour the evolution of drug resistance, but not so low that tumour cells are not killed. This could help to prolong the efficacy of the particular drug in treatment.
