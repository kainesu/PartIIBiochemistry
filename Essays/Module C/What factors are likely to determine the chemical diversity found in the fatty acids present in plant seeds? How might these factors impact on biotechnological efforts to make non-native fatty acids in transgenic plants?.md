**What factors are likely to determine the chemical diversity found in the fatty acids present in plant seeds? How might these factors impact on biotechnological efforts to make non-native fatty acids in transgenic plants?**

# Factors 
- Substrate specificity of enzymes involved in lipid synthesis – desaturases, elongases 
	- Carrier specificity 
	- Lipid specificity 
- Complement of acyl exchange enzymes -> how porous/flexible is the exchange between different metabolic pools? 
	- More easily exchanged -> more balance between the pools? 
	- More difficult to exchange -> could result in vectorial flow of lipids to a particular pool 
- Competition vs cooperation between pathways
	- Competition – pathways act on the same substrate. Results in bottleneck for the substrate, but diversifies products 
	- Cooperation – pathways synthesise the same product from different substrates, resulting in redundancy and increased total flux
- Evolution/phylogenetics 

# Implications for metabolic engineering 

The aim of biotechnological efforts is to engineer plants to synthesise a specific, economically-valuable lipid. This would be opposing the existing chemical diversity of lipids in plants. 

All of the above factors need to be addressed to achieve high yields of the desired lipid without compromising agronomic fitness. 

| Factor                     | Biotech solution                                           |
| -------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------- |
| Substrate specificity      | Engineer enzyme, heterologous expression,                  |
| Acyl exchange              | Engineer enzyme, heterologous expression, alter expression |
| Competition vs cooperation | Alter enzyme expression                                    | 

More generally, selecting the right host plant is also important. Ideally, choose a host plant whose enzymes, metabolic pathways are already amenable to the synthesis of the desired lipid 
e.g. *Camelina sativa*
