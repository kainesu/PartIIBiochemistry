**Discuss the metabolic pathways of fatty acid biosynthesis in plants and how they might be manipulated for bioengineering.**

# Metabolic pathways
- TAG synthesis 
	- Different metabolic pools 
- MAGs? 

# Manipulation for bioengineering 
- Overcoming substrate bottlenecks (competition for a substrate)
- Resolving substrate dichotomy
- Improving flow into TAG pool --> "Pull down" leads to more flux through upstream pathway via Le Chatelier's principle 
- Reducing lipid turnover
