**Discuss the factors that can affect expression of transgenes in transgenic organisms.**

# Transcription 
- Positional effects 
- Promoter 
- Transgene copy number
- Sequences for RNA processing
- Inclusion of some introns can increase expression, e.g. PRF2 in *Arabidopsis thaliana*
- A silencing suppressor can help prevent silencing 

# Translation 
- Codon optimisation 
	- For tRNA abundance 
	- G/C rich vs A/T rich depending on organism 
- Strength of RBS
	- Optimal kozak sequence 
- Considerations for secondary structure
	- Avoid secondary structure in 5' UTR as this represses translation
	- Avoid secondary structure too close to cap as it inhibits loading of 43S onto mRNA
- No miRNA binding sites in 3' UTR or siRNA binding sites
- Localisation signals 

# Post-translational
- Inducible degrons (e.g. AID, Protac)
