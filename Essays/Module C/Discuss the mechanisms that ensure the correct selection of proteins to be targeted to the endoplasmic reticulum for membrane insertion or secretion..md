**Discuss the mechanisms that ensure the correct selection of proteins to be targeted to the endoplasmic reticulum for membrane insertion or secretion.**

# **Introduction**

One third of all genes encoding for proteins are targeted to the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) for sorting to most intracellular compartments, membrane insertion, or secretion. Incorrect localisation can lead to protein dysfunction or inappropriate expression of protein function, so it is critical that the cell is able to accurately target the appropriate proteins to the ER. At the same time, this can be challenging to accomplish given the huge diversity of non-cytosolic proteins destined for the ER. Hence, numerous sophisticated mechanisms of protein targeting have evolved to ensure this accuracy, both co-translational and post-translational (Figure 1).

# **1. Co-translational pathways – SRP**

The first targeting pathway to be discovered is the signal recognition particle (SRP) pathway. It is a co-translational pathway that targets proteins to the ER while translation is still ongoing. The SRP selects proteins for targeting by recognising an N-terminal hydrophobic signal peptide that contains an AXA motif. During translation, the nascent chain associated complex (NAC) attached to the ribosome nascent chain complex (RNC) recruits the SRP to the RNC. The SRP subunit SRP54 is stationed at the exit site of the ribosome close to the ribosomal subunits L23a and L35, which allows it to scan nascent chains of translating ribosomes as they are synthesised so that it can contact the signal peptide via its M domain shortly after its emergence from the ribosomes. The M domain of SRP54 contains methionine bristles that are flexible and hydrophobic, providing SRP with sufficient plasticity to bind to different signal peptide sequences with some degree of accuracy. Hence, SRP54 recognition of the signal peptide represents the first round of selection of proteins for targeting. 

Upon recognition of the signal peptide, SRP54 undergoes multiple conformational rearrangements  that causes it to displace the nascent polypeptide-associated complex (NAC) from the RNC. This unblocks the translocon docking site on the ribosome subunit L23, allowing it to bind to Sec61 translocon on the ER membrane (Figure 2). The antagonistic binding by NAC thus helps to prevent inappropriate ribosome binding to the translocon when it is not translating an ER-destined protein. Gamerdinger et al (2015) found that in animal extract depleted of NAC via RNAi, the fraction of ribosomes attached to the ER membrane increases, which would likely be attributed to mislocalized proteins.

In addition, the C-terminal helix of SRP54 that occludes the signal peptide binding site is displaced upon binding to the signal peptide. This creates a threshold for binding, as the signal peptide has to be of sufficient hydrophobicity and affinity to the M domain to outcompete the helix, thus ensuring that SRP binds to an appropriate signal peptide sequence.  

To bring the RNC to the ER membrane, SRP binds to the SRα domain of the SRP receptor (SR) via their respective NG domains. Both SRP and SR contain GTPase domains, which are important for accurate targeting as a different nucleotide state is required to move forward with each step of the translocation, ensuring that the process is unidirectional (Figure 3). Firstly, for SR to be functional, SRβ has to be loaded with GTP by an exchange factor (possibly Sec61) so that it can bind SRα. As SRβ resides in the ER membrane, GTP binding is ultimately required for dimerisation and thus localisation of the SRP-RNC complex to the ER membrane. Secondly, upon interaction, the SRP-SR complex binds another molecule of GTP, and GTP hydrolysis causes conformational changes in the SRP-SR complex that releases ADP and the RNC, allowing it to bind to the translocon. Finally, the ribosome completes synthesis of the polypeptide, which drives it through the translocon.

Correct cargo loading helps to stabilise this early SRP-SR intermediate to accelerate complex assembly while delaying GTP hydrolysis. This delay may provide a window of time for SRP to control the fidelity of protein targeting, as incorrect cargos would cause premature GTP hydrolysis, which aborts the targeting reaction before the cargo can be unloaded into the translocon. Zhang et al (2010) found evidence for such “kinetic proofreading” by determining the GTPase rates from cargo-SRP-SR complexes, and found that correct cargos lowered the rate compared to the no cargo control, while incorrect cargos did not significantly change the rate. 

# **2. Post-translational translocation – EMC, GET, and SND**

However, the SRP pathway is insufficient to target all ER-destined proteins to the ER. SRP molecules do not exist in equimolar amounts to ribosomes, so it will dissociate from the RNC if it does not encounter a targeting signal within the N-terminus. As such, proteins with targeting motifs positioned away from the N-terminus would not be captured as efficiently by the SRP scanning mechanism, and may use alternative pathways. On the other hand, very short proteins (e.g. insulin) may be synthesised too quickly for their signal sequence to be recognised by SSRP. Moreover, given the substrate diversity of ER-targeted proteins, it would be sensible for there to be multiple targeting pathways that are optimised for targeting proteins with different characteristics. Having more than one pathway may even introduce redundancy into the system, allowing proteins to be targeted by other pathways if their default pathway becomes dysfunctional. These pathways generally involve a cytosolic chaperone that interacts with the protein, then targets it to a specific ER-localised receptor. 

### Guided Entry of Tail-anchored (GET)/TMD recognition complex 40 (TRC40) pathway

Proteins targeted by GET usually have high hydrophobicity C-terminal transmembrane domains (TMDs) or are GPI-anchored proteins. In a similar manner to SRP, a co-chaperone SGTA binds the TMD upon its emergence from the ribosome, which it hands over to the Get4-Get5 complex that in turn transfers the protein to Get3. Get4 binds preferentially to the ATP-bound conformation of Get3, ensuring that it is in the correct conformation for accurate binding to the C-terminal hydrophobic sequence. Lastly, the protein is passed to Get1/Get2 in the ER membrane, which act as membrane integrases to insert the hydrophobic sequences into the membrane (Figure 4).

Figure 4: GET pathway in yeast.

Not unlike the GTPase cycle in the SRP-SR complex, Get3 goes through an ATPase cycle that helps ensure accurate targeting of ER-destined proteins. Upon binding to its substrate, Get3 undergoes ATP hydrolysis, and the ADP-bound Get3-protein complex is captured by Get2 and transferred to Get1. This transfer relies on the ATP already having been hydrolysed, as the Get1 binding site on Get3 is partially buried when it is bound to ATP, ensuring that only Get3 loaded with correct cargo can be targeted to ER. The timing of hydrolysis could also be subject to kinetic proofreading regulation. Finally, Get1 binding promotes Get3 release of ADP and the substrate, and the rebinding of ATP to Get3 dissociates it from Get1. Clearly, as each interaction changes the nucleotide state of Get3, the process of translocation is driven unidirectionally, thus ensuring selective targeting of proteins to the ER. 

### ER Membrane protein Complex (EMC) pathway

Unlike the GET pathway, the EMC pathway is not as well understood, but it is known to target proteins with low hydrophobicity C-terminal TMDs. After translation, calmodulin acts as a cytosolic chaperone that binds to the TMD, and it is able to capture a wide range of hydrophobic substrates as it also contains a flexible Met-rich region. The proteins are eventually transferred to the endoplasmic reticulum membrane complex (EMC), which acts as a membrane insertase. More experimental evidence will likely be needed to fully elucidate the mechanism of this pathway. 

### SRP-independent targeting (SND) pathway

The SND pathway is a third pathway for targeting proteins post-translationally, and can compensate for the loss of both the SRP and GET pathways. While its full mechanism is not clear, Aviram et al (2016) proposed that the ribosome-associated SND protein 1 (Snd1) may capture nascent substrates, while the ER-localised proteins Snd2 and Snd3 are involved in substrate capture and transfer to the translocon. Similar to GET and EMC, this pathway also targets proteins with TMDs more downstream than the optimal recognition window of SRP26. Aviram et al (2016) used proximity-specific ribosome profiling to show that in Δsnd yeast strains, some proteins were depleted from the ER membrane, suggesting mislocalization. 

# 3. Error correction

Despite the above described targeting and quality control mechanisms, incorrect proteins are still taken to the ER on occasion, as no molecular recognition event is 100% efficient. Fully accurate targeting is challenging because of the degeneracy of targeting signals, and targeting signals for different compartments can often be similar. For example, Costa et al (2018) used proximity-specific ribosome profiling to show that, upon auxin-induced degradation of SRP, transcripts normally targeted to the ER were mislocalized to the mitochondria. As such, there is a need for the cell to correct for any such mislocalization errors, often by degrading the mislocalized proteins. These error correction pathways are the last resort for sorting out proteins that have escaped all the above selectivity controls, especially under conditions of stress. 

When proteins with long hydrophobic sequences are mislocalized to the cytosol, they may be degraded following interaction with Bag6. Bag6 interacts with the E3 ligase RNF126 to mediate the ubiquitination of such mislocalized proteins, resulting in their degradation by proteasomes. On the other hand, if proteins are mislocalized to the mitochondria, an AAA-ATPase known as Msp1 extracts the proteins from the membrane through a pore formed by homohexamerisation of its ATPase domain. Okreglak & Walter (2014) demonstrated the function of Msp1 by following the localisation of GFP-tagged Pex15 in Δget3 yeast strains. Pex15 is a protein localised by the GET pathway. In Δget3 Δmsp1 strains, GFP-Pex15 was localised to the mitochondria, while overexpressing Msp1 cleared Pex15 from the mitochondrial membrane. 

# **Conclusion **

Due to the low specificity of targeting motifs in ER-destined proteins, accurate targeting is definitely an involved task for the cell, since a single molecular recognition event is insufficient to identify correct ER targeting sequences. As such, cells have evolved multiple steps for selecting the correct protein for targeting, and only upon passing all these filters would a protein be able to pass through the translocon or be inserted into the ER membrane. However, many of these targeting mechanisms remain poorly understood, and further microscopy, proteomic and structural studies would likely be helpful in uncovering the interactions between proteins in each pathway. Many proteins are also targeted by multiple pathways, and more study is needed on the interactions between these different pathways. The insights gained from such studies could be helpful in the treatment of diseases caused by ER protein mislocalization, such as prion-induced neurodegeneration (Rane et al 2008) and diabetes (Guo et al 2014).
