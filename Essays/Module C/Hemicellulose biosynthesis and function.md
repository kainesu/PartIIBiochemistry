**To what extent do we understand the biosynthesis and function of hemicelluloses?**

Generally we understand xylans much more than other hemicelluloses. 

Mannans difficult to study because they are more abundant in gymnosperms, which are not genetically tractable and are difficult to grow in a lab (cf angiosperms which has _Arabidopsis_ as a model species) 

*Experimental evidence important 

**Introduction**
* What are hemicelluloses
* Why is studying hemicelluloses important 
* Thesis statement 

**Biosynthesis** 
Main backbone is synthesised by cellulose synthase-like enzymes. 

Backbone decorations are made by different glycosyltransferases 

Remaining questions about biosynthesis. 
* Evolutionary origin of biosynthetic enzymes 
* Regulation of biosynthesis. What determines what side chains are added? 
* Have all UDP-sugar importers been identified? 
* Structure determination of biosynthetic components and how they contribute to biosynthesis 
    * Many GTs lack structures e.g. GT43, GT47s involved in xylan backbone synthesis 
    * Important to understand CAZyme specificity… (see my project lol) 

<span style="text-decoration:underline;">Xylan </span>
* Xylan biosynthesis components not clear 
* Backbone 
    * Catalytic activity of various β(1->4) xylan synthases have not been determined yet 
        * IRX9 
        * IRX14
        * IRX10 
        * Identified from genetic screens – mutants in these genes have irregular xylem phenotype; xylan is involved in secondary walls in _Arabidopsis_, so xylan deficiency compromises xylem load bearing ability 
        * Have yet to demonstrate their catalytic activity _in vitro_ 
        * Also not clear which genes are redundant 
            * IRX10 and IRX10-like probably be redundant, e.g. _Selaginella_ and _Physcomitrium_ only have 1 IRX10/IRX10L ortholog
* Sidechains 
    * Ara_f_T predicted from expression data 
        * α(1→2)-ArafT, α(1→3)-ArafT, α-Ara_f_T 
    * α(1→2)-GlcAT – no candidate proposed yet 
* For conifers and some dicots, the reducing end of xylan molecules has a unique tetrasaccharide structure ![[Pasted image 20230524195026.png|500]]

<span style="text-decoration:underline;">Xyloglucan </span>
* Backbone
    * Arabidopsis CSCL4 – beta(1->4)-glucan synthase confirmed to be involved in XyG biosynthesis 
        * 4 other CSLC members may have a role as well (1-3, 5) 
* Xylose sidechains 
    * XXT1 
    * XXT2 
* Galactosyltransferase for second xylose in XXXG 
    * Unclear which enzyme incorporate galactose on the second position of repeating unit 
        * Li et al (80) identified a GT in subgroup A of GT47 as responsible, but not confirmed which particular one; there are 10 members in this subgroup. 
* Galactosyltransferase for third xylose in XXXG 
    * Reference 84 
    * GT47 
* Fucosyltransferase
    * Purified from pea via a biochemical approach 
    * Arabidopsis ortholog expressed and assayed _in vitro_
    * Genetic approach – fucose-deficient _Arabidopsis_ mutant _mur2_ has a mutation in the same gene
    * Specific to third galactose in repeating XXXG unit of xyloglucan 
        * _Arabidopsis_ mutant _mur3_ was fucose-deficient as it was mutated in XyG beta-(1->2)-galactosyltransferase; without galactose, cannot fucosylate 
* Acetylation of galactosyl from acetyl-CoA 
    * Acetyltransferases and acetyl-CoA transporters have yet to be identified

**Function**

Hemicelluloses have various functions. 

Structures are known, how to relate structure to function? 

Hemicelluloses partially coat cellulose microfibrils – this may be to modulate interactions between cellulose fibrils. At hot spots of cellulose interactions, hemicellulose can affect these interactions. May be involved in assembly of secondary cell wells 

* Main role is to tether cellulose microfibrils -> strength cell wall 
* E.g. Yu et al (2022) – cellulose is disorganised in mutant _Arabidopsis_ that lack XyG and beta-GGM 

<span style="text-decoration:underline;">Xylans </span>
* Even pattern of decoration allows it to bind flush to the hydrophilic surface of cellulose

<span style="text-decoration:underline;">Mannans </span>
* Glucomannan is essential for mucilage adherence to cellulose rays in _Arabidopsis_
    * Yu et al 2018, 2022 
* Involved in hypocotyl cell expansion 
* _Arabidopsis _development
    * _CSLA7_ impairs pollen function

Deletion of hemicelluloses _in vivo _by deleting genes involved in their biosynthesis, or reconstitution _ex vivo_? 

Solid state NMR has been key to elucidating interactions between hemicellulose and cellulose 

PACE (LOL) 

Remaining questions about hemicelluloses. 
* What determines the composition of different hemicelluloses in different clades? 
    * E.g., Why are there more mannans in gymnosperms and more xylans in angiosperms? 

**Conclusion**
* Engineering cell walls
* Production of biofuels or more easily processed gymnosperm wood
