**How do cells signal to the actin cytoskeleton?**\

# Introduction 

Actin is highly conserved across the tree of life, being important to many cellular processes from motility, to internal transport, to adhesion. This single molecule is able to form a variety of structures, such as filopodia, lamellipodia, and invadopodia. As all actin structures are made up of the same base G-actin monomer, cells must have other mechanisms to regulate the way actin filaments form. While the formation of these structures is initiated by a variety of input stimuli, these signals tend to converge on three Rho-family GTPases, namely Cdc42, Rac, and RhoA, which then signal to the actin cytoskeleton via a series of effector proteins. These three Rho family proteins may also interact with each other. 

# Upstream of Rho GTPases 

**A variety of external signals can stimulate cells to form particular actin structures.** Such signals can be chemical in nature – for example, neutrophils can respond to gradients of formylated peptides from bacteria by increasing the nucleation and polymerisation of actin. This results in the formation of pseudopodia in the direction of these chemoattractants. On the other hand, the signals can also be mechanical. E-cadherin in _Drosophila _can activate Rac when it senses mechanical tension. Such tension can be generated from the movement of an adjacent adherent cell, allowing for coordinated, directional movement of groups of cells. 

**Relay of these stimuli to the Rho GTPases often goes by way of Rho guanine nucleotide exchange factors (GEFs) and GTPase-activating proteins (GAPs)**, which regulate the nucleotide state of the Rho GTPAses (Figure 1). In fact, these GEFs and GAPs are often responsible for directing Rho GTPases to different effector pathways. As such, the same Rho GTPases will often be implicated in the formation of different actin architectures as they are activated by different GEFs/GAPs in response to stimuli. For example, in mouse embryonic fibroblasts, the Rac GEF P-Rex1 promotes cell migration, as it enhances the interaction of Rac1 with FLII, an actin remodelling protein. In contrast, a different Rac GEF called TIAM1 blocks migration. Hence, the GEFs/GAPs of Rho GTPases have an expanded function beyond just catalysing changes in the nucleotide state. They also facilitate interactions with different proteins to regulate Rho GTPase signalling to the actin cytoskeleton.

# Rho GTPases signal to the actin cytoskeleton via effector proteins

Rho GTPases do not directly affect actin cytoskeleton architecture themselves. Rather, t**hey activate pathways that lead to the activation of proteins that nucleate, elongate, bundle, or turnover the actin filaments**, among other functions. This will be illustrated with the examples of filopodia and lamellipodia. 


## Cdc42 and RIF induce filopodia formation 

Filopodia are protrusions made up of parallel actin microfilaments, usually bundled by actin-bundling proteins (e.g. fascin). They are more polarised than lamellipodia, and the barbed ends of the filaments point towards the cell membrane. When the filaments are extended, the leading edge is pushed forward, thus forming the filopodia. Filopodia can be used for sensing, such as to detect the direction of chemotropic cues, as well as in adhesion and in neuronal growth cones. 

To achieve this particular architecture, Cdc42 is first activated by the lipid PI(4,5)P<sub>2</sub> at the cell membrane, possibly via the action of a GEF. Cdc42-GTP can then interact with WASP and N-WASP to relieve their autoinhibition, as well as with Toca-1, which is required for WASP/N-WASP activation. Activated WASP/N-WASP in turn  activates the ARP2/3 complex that nucleates G-actin into filaments (Figure 2A). 

Cdc42 may also signal to actin via other pathways that does not necessarily involve N-WASP and WASP (Figure 2B). Snapper et al (2001) found that N-WASP and WASP are not strictly necessary for filopodia formation, as N-WASP deficient fibroblasts were still able to form filopodia. One of these other pathways may involve insulin receptor substrate p53 (IRSp53), which forms a complex with Cdc42, WAVE2 (a WASP family protein), and the ENA/VASP protein MENA. The latter promotes filament elongation by protecting barbed ends from capping proteins (anti-capping), as well as by interacting with profilin. IRSp53 can also cluster membrane PIP<sub>2</sub> lipids via its I-BAR domain, which would then activate PIP<sub>2</sub> binding proteins in a localised region, such as N-WASP.

Figure 2: Cdc42 signalling pathways involved in filopodia formation.

Apart from Cdc42, another small GTPase called Rho in filopodia (RIF) may also be involved in filopodia formation (Figure 3), although these filopodia tend to be longer than the ones associated with Cdc42 activation. It does this by activating the formin Dia2, which initiates filament assembly and nucleates the polymerisation of unbranched actin filaments. By binding to the barbed end, they Dia2 can insert G-actin monomers, prevent capping, and recruit profilin-G actin complexes. This thus promotes the formation of more polarised filaments, which possibly accounts for the increased filopodia length. 

![[Pasted image 20230527150603.png]]
Figure 3: RIF regulates filopodia formation via Dia2.

Although many of these interactions involved in filopodia formation have been established, the overall process of filopodia formation is less clear. In one model, called the “convergent elongation model”, actin filaments in filopodia arise from ARP2/3 complex nucleated-lamellipodial actin networks. When some of these filaments are protected from capping (e.g. ENA/VASp, Dia2), they can be brought together by myosin-X to form the filopodia. In another model, called the “_de novo _filament nucleation model”, ARP2/3 is not involved, and instead only Dia2 and VASP are required. Whatever the exact mechanism of filopodia formation, it is at least clear that Rho GTPases are critical to activating all effector proteins involved. 


## Rac, RhoA, and Cdc42 are involved in lamellipodia formation 

Lamellipodia are flat membrane protrusions made up of branched networks of actin. Similar to filopodia, the barbed ends of the actin filaments are oriented towards the cell membrane. Growth of these filaments push the membrane forward, thus creating motility. 

One of the GTPases involved in lamellipodia formation is Rac, which can be activated in various ways: by Rac GEFs (e.g. TIAM1), other Rho GTPases (e.g. RhoG), or phosphorylation by kinases. Rac can then activate IRSp53, which functions b as previously described. It also activates nucleation promoting factors, e.g. WASP, N-WASP, and WAVE 1-3. The latter forms part of a WAVE complex with several other proteins, including PIR121. Rac can activate WAVE proteins by binding to tPIR121, causing structural rearrangements within the WAVE complex that expose the WAVE C-terminal WCA domain. WAVE then interacts with and activates Arp2/3 via the WCA domain. Finally, the ARP2/3 complex creates branched actin networks by binding to the sides of actin filaments to stimulate the formation of branches. As the branches grow, they push the membrane forward. Other actin nucleators implicated in lamellipoda formation can stimulate elongation without branching. This includes formin (activated by RhoA) and Spire family proteins. The balance of signalling to ARP2/3 versus formin and Spire may determine how branched the actin array is at the leading edge, and different types of actin nucleators may work together synergistically to form lamellipodia rapidly. 

The Rho GTPases also signal to the actin cytoskeleton to regulate its turnover. Cdc42 and Rac can activate PAK and LIM kinase, which phosphorylate ADF/cofilin and inhibits their activity. ADF/cofilin promotes the dissociation of P<sub>i</sub> from older regions of the lamellipodia and severs ADP-actin filaments. As such, inhibition of ADF/cofilin reduces filament turnover.

# Conclusion 

The actin cytoskeleton undergoes dynamic changes and can be arranged in a diverse array of structures. Apart from the filopodia and lamellipodia, actin makes up other structures like invadopodia, pseudopodia, stress fibres, and blebs. These changes are regulated by complex networks of signalling that can be traced back to the Rho GTPases as the main signalling node. Many of the effector proteins downstream of different Rho GTPases are similar, including nucleators (e.g. ARP2/3, Spire, formins), bundlers (e.g. fascin), and anti-cappers (e.g. ENA-VASP), yet not all these effectors are involved to the same extent in the formation of each type of actin structure. Probably, signalling to actin from the Rho GTPases is context dependent, and depends on other factors such as tissue type or developmental stage which changes what effector proteins are present for Rho GTPase to signal to. In addition, the balance between different effector proteins results in heterogeneity between instances of the same structure, affecting the extent of branching, turnover,  width, and other properties. Future research might focus on clarifying the timing and localization of each interaction in signalling pathways, as well as how the makeup of effectors present precisely affects actin architecture. 

# Discarded 

No space to discuss RhoA, but involved in stress fibres and focal adhesions, and similarly signals to different sets of effector proteins. 

Some effectors are common between Rho GTPases pathways, some are not.

Very context-dependendent – e.g. tissue, developmental stage. What effectors are present to interact with? Also dynamics between different effector proteins → different levels of branching, turnover, etc, result in dynamic and diverse structures 

While Rho GTPase initiates the cascade of signalling, the nature of this cascade and the exact proteins involved are diverse, and this is what leads to the diversity of actin architectures in cells. 

It also highlights the difficult of assigning function to genes/proteins in cells as it is very much interaction-dependent. “Interactome”?

* GEFs and GAPs are the mediators of signals to Rho GTPases. A diversity of GEFs and GAPs are needed to regulate the function of the Rho GTPases for different cellular processes
    * E.g. In mouse embryonic fibroblasts, Rac GEF P-Rex1 promotes cell migration, while a different GEF TIAM1 blocks migration. This is because P-Rex1 enhances interaction of Rac1 with FLII, an actin remodelling protein. As such, GEFs can direct the Rho GTPases to activate different effector pathways that affect actin architecture differently. 
* Cdc42 and RIF induce filopodia formation 
    * Cdc42 and RIF are the Rho GTPases involved in signalling to the actin cytoskeleton to form filopodia. 
    * Filopodia are protrusions made up of actin microfilaments that are bundled by actin-bundling proteins. Filopodia are used for sensing, such as detecting the direction of chemotropic cues, as well as in adhesion and neuronal growth-cones. 
    * Structure of filopodia – contain parallel bundles of F-actin, more polarised than lamellipodia. Barbed ends point towards the cell membrane, and extension of the F-actin pushes the leading edge forward, forming a protrusion in the cell membrane 
    * To achieve this particular architecture, the cell must signal to actin to reduce branching and enhance elongation. 
    * An external stimulus (e.g.?) causes the production of PI(4,5)P<sub>2</sub>, which activates Cdc42, possibly via the action of a GEF, to induce guanine nucleotide exchange in Cdc42 from GDP to GTP. Cdc42 can then interact with WASP and N-WASP to relieve their autoinhibition. It also interacts with Toca-1, which seems to be required for WASP/N-WASP activation. Activation of WASP/N-WASP then allows for activation of the ARP2/3 complex which nucleates G-actin. 
    * However, N-WASP and WASP may not be a necessary part of the signalling pathway from Cdc42 to actin, as fibroblasts that lack N-WASP and WASP can still produce filopodia 
        * [Snapper et al (2001) ](https://www.nature.com/articles/ncb1001-897)
    * As such Cdc42 may signal to the actin cytoskeleton via other pathways. For example, it may involve the insulin receptor substrate p53 (IRSp53), which forms a complex with Cdc42, WAVE2 (WASP family protein), and an ENA/VASP protein MENA. 
        * WAVE2 is a WASP family protein 
        * ENA/VASP proteins promote elongation of the actin filaments to form filopodia by preventing capping of barbed ends (anti-capping). They also bind to profilin to enhance protection 
        * VASP also can deliver actin monomers to filopodia tips 
        * N-WASP is also activated by tyrosine phosphorylation 
        * ENA/VASP binding to actin filaments is inhibited by phosphorylation 
    * IRSp53 may also directly signal actin to form filopodia by inducing membrane tubulation or F-actin bundling 
        * IRSp53 interacts with Cdc42 ,Rac1 via N-terminal region
        * Interacts with WAVE2, MENA through SH3 domain 
        * EPS8 binds to IRSp53, it acts as a capping protein 
        * Via I-BAR domain, could cluster membrane PIP<sub>2</sub>, which then activates PIP2 binding proteins e.g. N-WASP 
        * Inhibited by threonine phosphorylation 
    * Apart from Cdc42, another small GTPase called Rho in filopodia (RIF) may also be involved in filopodia formation, which tend to be longer than filopodia formed from Cdc42 activation. RIF activates the formin Dia2 to promote nucleation and elongation of F-actin arrays
        * Formins such as Dia2 initiate filament assembly and nucleate polymerisation of unbranched actin filaments. By binding to the barbed end they can help insert G-actin and prevent capping activity. Recruitment of profilin-G-actin complexes 
    * Fascin bundles the actin filaments in filopodia. 
        * Fascin binding to actin filaments is inhibited by phosphorylation 
        * Protein kinase C (PKC) phosphorylates fascin, and this phosphorylation is regulated by Rac – Rac inhibits filopodia formation? 
* Rab35 interacts with fascin and Cdc42 and may deliver both to the filopodia – colocalisation to ensure they act together? 
    * Probably, all these signalling pathways contribute to filopodia formation in some way; the filopodia may form from a branched network of actin with lamellipodia,  nucleated by Arp2/3. Actin branches that are protected by ENA/VASP or formin converging. 
    * Myosin X can induce filopodia assembly 
        * It prefers to move on fascin-actin bundles
        * It may deliver cargo e.g. actin monomers to filopodia tips
        * Motor function could induce actin filament convergence, resulting in filopodium formation 
    * Formin displacers/inhibitors may terminate filopodia 
        * E.g. in budding yeast, BUD14 binds to FH2 domain of Bnr formin to displace it from barbed end 
* Rac and lamellipodia
    * Explain how Rac induces actin to form lamellipodia  
    * Lamellipodia – branched network of actin 
    * Many extracellular stimuli induce lamellipodia formation, e.g. growth factors, cytokines, cell adhesion receptors
