**What mechanisms control the selectivity of protein targeting within the endocytic and secretory pathway?**

1. Selection of cargo 
	1. Sorting signals in proteins bind to receptors or chaperones
		1. signal peptide and SRP 
		2. ER -> ERGIC DxD, ExE (glycan seqyebce)
		3. Golgi/ETGIC -> ER KDEL/HDEL (by KDEL receptor)
	2. Receptors bind to adaptors via motif in cytoplasmic domain 
		1. Signal motifs
			2. PM to early endosome -> YXXΦ by AP2
			3. TGN to endosomes -> YXXΦ by AP1 
		2. Different adaptors associated with different compartments 
		3. Adaptor links receptor to a membrane coat 
	4. Vesicle formation – COP I, COP II, ESCRT, retromers 
		1. Arf 
2. Targeting of proteins 
	1. By chaperones (SRP, TRC40, SGTA etc) – technically all secretory proteins must pass through the ER. 
		2. Kinetic proofreading
	2. Rab conversion 
		1. Rab GDIs 
		2. Recruit tethers 
	3. "Pre-targeting" – tethers
	4. SNAREs and their regulation 
		1. Combinatorial fusion
		2. Reconstitute physiological cargo flow on their own, but at low efficiency
		3. Signal induced-fusion for additional selectivity e.g. synaptogamin 
	5. Ubiquitination of cargo receptors in endosomal pathway 
	6. Tunnels between compartments 
	7. Rab conversion 
	8. Cytoskeletal tracks and motor proteins – adaptors can bind to specific motor proteins (e.g. see [[GrangerEtAl_2014]])
	9. Lipid identity
		1. SNX bind PtdIns(3)P
		2. AP-2 binds PI(4,5)P2 on plasma membrane 
		3. Membrane thickness? PM > Golgi > ER 

**General principles**
- Energy gradients... investment of energy by GTPases throughout the pathways 
- Multiple checkpoints to ensure selectivity – important for low complexity signals 
- "Compartment boundaries along the recycling or degradation pathways seem blurred at the molecular level, in particular when following a single component. It is probably the interplay between key components that defines the functional boundaries in each pathway"
