**Many different types and topologies of integral membrane proteins are inserted into the endoplasmic reticulum. How well do we understand these processes of membrane protein targeting and insertion?**

# 1. How are proteins targeted to the ER?

* Proofreading understood well for SRP  
* For other pathways, less understood – maybe similar principles to SRP?
* How are the hydrophobic TMDs transported through the cytosol? 

# 2. Which pathway of membrane insertion is preferred for a particular membrane protein?

* How are secreted proteins translocated? 
* How are single pass/first TMD of multipass protein inserted? 
    * N-terminal anchored proteins are inserted via Sec61 
        * Mechanism of how this occurs 
        * Structural evidence 
        * But how does the structure relate to its function? 
    * What do we understand about it 
* How are tail-anchored proteins inserted? 
* How are multipass proteins inserted? 
    * Iterative model (Sec61-dependent) vs multipass translocon model (Sec61-independent) 
    * Current evidence suggests that EMC may insert TMDs of polytopic proteins. For some proteins, this is Sec61 dependent 
    * For other proteins, it is Sec61-independent 
    * The determinants of whether the first TMD is inserted via EMC or Sec61 is unclear. Smalinskaite and Hegde (2022) have proposed that the charges on the TMD could be a factor, with positively-charged TMDs being inserted with Sec61. 
* Mysterious role of SND pathway? 

# 3. What are the mechanistic determinants of the topology of TMDs?  
- Structural determinants – local sequence determinants, distant determinants 
	- Machine learning to generate rules tables for signal sequence? 
- Mechanism of membrane insertase complexes – how does structure relate to function
