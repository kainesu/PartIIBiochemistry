**Discuss how the structures and conformations of plant cell wall polysaccharides influence their function and breakdown by microbes.**

# **Introduction**

The plant cell wall is composed of a complex architecture of polysaccharides, such that no single polysaccharide on its own _in vitro_ can fully recapitulate the mechanical properties of the cell wall. The main classes of polysaccharides are cellulose, hemicelluloses, and pectins, each with their own unique structures that also interact to result in emergent cell wall properties. The relative proportions of each type of polysaccharide also varies between species, developmental stage, and cell wall type, aiding in the survival of the plant. Their structures also determine how they are broken down by microbes that use energy or materials from plants for their growth, with accessibility being a major issue that microbes must overcome for efficient digestion.  

# **1. Cellulose**

Cellulose is a β(1→4) linked glucan chain where each glucose monomer is inverted with respect to its neighbours. This results in a linear polymer with –OH groups that project out from two sides of the chain. Cellulose chains pack into larger structures called microfibrils, with hydrogen bonding between adjacent OH groups and pi-stacking interactions between sugar rings. In plants, the microfibrils have a Iβ crystalline structure, wherein crystallographically distinct chains are arranged in alternating sheets. Packing of the chains into the crystalline structure of a microfibril is what gives cellulose its structural integrity. Further bundling of the microfibrils to form larger fibres has been observed in certain cells, such as cotton fibres, which likely modifies the mechanical properties of the cell wall, possibly to increase its tensile strength since a bundle of microfibrils would be harder to rupture than just a single fibril. 

As each cellulose chain projects equatorial –OH groups in only two directions, the microfibril structure as a whole has a hydrophilic surface and a hydrophobic surface that each interact with other cell wall polysaccharides (e.g. xyloglucan, xylan) or lignin with different affinities. The hydrophobic surface, consisting of exposed sugar rings, can interact via pi-stacking interactions, while the hydrophilic surface interacts via hydrogen bonding. 

Cellulose microfibrils are thought to contain 18 chains in total based on wide-angle X-ray scattering studies as well as the fact that cellulose synthase complex (CSC) rosettes are arranged as a hexamer of trimers. The particular arrangement of these 18 chains may have implications for how they interact with the other cell wall polysaccharides. Density functional theory calculations by Yang & Kubicki (2020) suggest that the cellulose chains have a 234432 arrangement, which is more stable than other arrangements and is also consistent with the arrangement of CSC rosettes. Compared to other possible arrangements (e.g. 333333, 34443), the surface area of each of the hydrophilic and hydrophobic surfaces would differ, which could affect the extent of interaction with other component polysaccharides. For example, xyloglucan is more rigid when it interacts with the hydrophobic surface than when bound to the hydrophilic surface. 

Due to the aforementioned crystalline nature of cellulose microfibrils, water and enzymes have limited access to exposed cellulose chains, making cellulose recalcitrant to enzymatic digestion. This is particularly an issue for hydrolytic cellulases, which requires free ends as there has to be an active site nucleophile on either side of the glycosidic bond for hydrolysis to occur. This makes it difficult for hydrolysis to occur along crystalline regions where only one face of the cellulose fibril is accessible. However, recently discovered fungal lytic polysaccharide monooxygenases (LPMOs) are able to oxidatively attack cellulose chains from just one side, which could allow for the formation of more free ends for hydrolytic enzymes to act on. Such enzymes include endoglucanases as well as cellobiohydrolases that can act from the reducing end (CBH I) or the non-reducing end (CBH II). Subsequently, β-glucosidases can cleave cellobiose produced by cellobiohydrolase to fully depolymerise the cellulose, and the resultant glucose can be absorbed by fungi or other microbes for metabolism. Overall, the structure of cellulose results in the evolution of multiple cellulose-digesting enzymes that act in a cascade to efficiently degrade cellulose.

# **2. Hemicelluloses**

Hemicelluloses are a diverse class of β-linked polysaccharides that are often substituted with side chains consisting of 1 or multiple sugar residues. They include the xylans, xyloglucans, mannans, and glucomannans, though the first two of these have been more extensively studied. The substitutions are also referred to as “decorations”, while the main hemicellulose chain is the “backbone”. The main function of hemicelluloses is to reinforce the mechanical strength of the cell wall via interactions with cellulose at particular “hotspots” along cellulose fibrils. As such, variations in the structure of the hemicellulose can have a large impact on the overall properties of the cell wall. 

For example, in xyloglucan, the main backbone consists of β-glucan (cellulose), with mainly xylosyl decorations. Xyloglucan adopts a random coiled shape rather than an extended conformation like cellulose, which limits its interaction with cellulose surfaces. The size of the backbone also seems to be important for interaction with cellulose – Lopez et al (2010) used isothermal titration calorimetry to determine that a minimum of 12 glucosyl residues is needed for xyloglucan to interact with cellulose, and that binding capacity increases with the size of the xyloglucan. Sidechain decorations can also be important for interaction with cellulose, probably via pi-stacking interactions with the sugar rings on the hydrophobic surface, although some studies suggest that fucose decorations improve binding affinity by providing more –OH groups for hydrogen bonding. On the other hand, a xyloglucan that is highly substituted might actually reduce its binding affinity for cellulose due to steric hindrance between the side chains and cellulose fibrils. As such, the precise configuration of decorations on xyloglucan will affect how closely it interacts with cellulose and thus the overall conformation and properties of the cell wall. 

Xylan, another hemicellulose, interacts with cellulose in a different way. The main backbone of β-linked xylose residues adopts a two-fold ribbon conformation, and this allows it to bind flat to the hydrophilic surface of cellulose. The pattern of decorations on the xylan backbone promote this interaction, as only alternate xylosyl residues are substituted. These substitutions include acetyl groups, glucuronic acid, and arabinose, with the particular variety of substitutions depending on the species. As the decorations are evenly spaced, they face away from the hydrophilic surface of the cellulose fibril, while the xylan backbone binds directly to the surface via hydrogen bonding. This xylan coat may mediate interactions with other cell wall polysaccharides and with lignin via its decorations which project away from the cellulose fibrils. In fact, in commelinids, xylan is linked to lignin via radical coupling with ferulate substitutions, which could aid in anchoring lignin to cellulose, and make the cell wall more resistant to enzymatic degradation. 

| Xyloglucan                                     | Xylan                                        |
| ---------------------------------------------- | -------------------------------------------- |
| Binds to hydrophobic surface of cellulose      | Binds to hydrophilic surface of cellulose    |
| Side chains mediate interaction with cellulose | Backbone mediates interaction with cellulose |
| Random coil shape                              | 2-fold screw                                 |

**Figure 2: Structure of glucuronoarabinoxylan and interaction with cellulose. **

Compared to cellulose, hemicelluloses are more accessible to enzymatic digestion by microbes, as they are not in a crystalline form and tend to be more mobile within the cell wall. That being said, not all parts of hemicelluloses are equally vulnerable, and regions that interact with cellulose tend to be more recalcitrant to digestion as they are less exposed to enzymes. Moreover, the extent of substitution can affect their breakdown as well, as individual decorations have to be removed by specific enzymes before the backbone can be efficiently depolymerised. For example, in xylan, different enzymes would be needed to remove glucuronyl and galactosyl decorations first. Then an endoxylanase can digest the backbone into smaller oligosaccharides, which is then digested into monosaccharides by a β-xylosidase. There is also the issue of cross-linking to lignin, which can reduce the accessibility of enzymes to xylans as well. As such, despite the structural dissimilarities with cellulose, digestion of hemicelluloses has to follow a certain order as well for efficient degradation.  

# **3. Pectins **

Pectins are acidic polysaccharides as they contain α(1→4)-linked galacturonic acid residues. Homogalacturonan is a pectin that contains only galacturonic acid, but rhamnogalacturonan I (RG I) contains both galacturonic acid and rhamnose residues, while RG II is a homogalacturonan with diverse decorations. Like hemicelluloses, pectin polysaccharides can interact with cellulose fibrils, preferably with the hydrophilic surface due to its ionic nature. These interactions may reduce direct cellulose-cellulose contact, thus lubricating microfibril motions in primary cell walls when the cell expands. Pectins may also mediate interactions between cellulose and hemicelluloses, such as by blocking access to cellulose surfaces and interacting with xyloglucan to prevent it from aligning to the hydrophobic surface of cellulose. However, load-bearing may be shared by all three types of polysaccharides. 

More importantly, pectin chains are able to cross-link indirectly with each other via ionic interactions between negatively charged carboxyl groups on galacturonyl residues and positively charged calcium cations. This results in the formation of “egg-box” structures that can aggregate to form multimers, and this behaviour drives the gelling properties of pectin. Extensive substitution (e.g. with galactan or arabinan on RG I) can prevent egg-box formation due to steric hindrance. 

The degree of cross-linking between pectin chains can also be modified by their degree of methylesterification. Homogalacturonan, for example, can be methyl-esterified at C6 carboxyl groups of the galacturonyl residues. The degree of methylesterification influences the extent to which the pectin can interact with calcium ions, since methylation reduces the negative charge on pectins and hence reduces ionic interactions with positively charged calcium cations. Two antiparallel pectin chains can thus indirectly cross-link with each other via calcium ions, forming an “egg-box” structure which can aggregate to form multimers. Temple et al (2022) observed such egg-box structures from solid state NMR data of homogalacturonan with a low degree of methylation. By knocking out two putative Golgi SAM transporters, they found that reducing methylation increases the proportion of 2<sub>1</sub> conformation egg-boxes and decreases their length. 
![[Pasted image 20230527152256.png]]
**Figure 3: Structure and cross-linking of pectins. **

Increased pectin gelation is thought to cause cell wall stiffening and restriction of cell wall growth. Why is this the case? Apart from changing the mechanical properties of the pectin itself, increased cross-linking may reduce interactions between pectin and hemicelluloses (e.g. xylan), which would enhance their interactions with cellulose. For example, reduced methylation has been found to enhance the interaction between cellulose and two-fold xylan, possibly because increased cross-linking between pectin chains reduced their interactions with xylan. 

In terms of microbial breakdown, various microbes are known to produce pectinolytic enzymes, such as polygalacturonases, pectin lyases, and pectin methylesterases. Pectins may be digested similarly to hemicelluloses, with exposed side chains being digested first before the main galacturonan backbone. However, the formation of egg-box structures may reduce the accessibility of enzymes to the face of the pectin chains where the carboxyl group is located, since this face interacts with the calcium ions and the paired pectin chain. As such, pectin methylesterases that reduce egg-box structure formation can promote accessibility and hence efficiency of enzymatic digestion. 

# **Conclusion**

The plant cell wall contains a plethora of polysaccharides whose properties have been critical to the structural integrity of plant cell walls. Different plant species have evolved to have different proportions of each plant cell wall polysaccharide in their cell walls, resulting in walls with different properties that allow them to adapt to their environment. While each individual polysaccharide is important, the interactions between them are equally crucial, and changes to these interactions result in a dynamic system where cell wall properties can be modified over time (e.g. developmental stage). This system is complicated by the presence of non-polysaccharide components, such as extensins and lignins, which are out of the scope of this discussion but are nevertheless important to cell wall properties as well. 

At the same time, this network architecture presents a challenge to microbes seeking to extract resources or energy from plants. Microbes have to be able to synthesise many different enzymes, or cooperate with other microbes, to produce a complement that can digest the diverse array of linkages present in cell walls. Another reason a large complement of enzymes is needed is that  accessibility is a huge barrier to digestion efficiency. As such, enzymes may act in a particular sequence to break down cell walls, with more mobile structures being digested first (e.g. hemicellulose side chains → hemicellulose backbones → cellulose?). As such, recalcitrance is not just a function of an individual polysaccharide’s properties, but also of the polysaccharides in its local environment.

Make a list of structural features for each polysaccharide, and show how they affect function/breakdown 



* Interactions with other polysaccharides 
* Functional groups that allow for covalent linkages between polysaccharides

Also, important to point out that these conformations are not in isolation but also meant to facilitate interactions between polysaccharides – hotspot model 

Effect of structure on function 



* Cellulose
    * Each glucose inverted with respect to neighbours

    * In plants, cellulose has Ιβstructure 
        * What is the function? 
        * Based on a study using Avicel, smaller xyloglucan polymers appear to penetrate deeper into the Avicel particle than can large polymers which are restricted to larger pores 
    * Hydrophilic surface and hydrophobic surface 
        * Each surface binds to xyloglucan, xylan, and lignin with different affinities 
        * Surfaces with the exposed sugar rings form hydrophobic surface with axial CH groups
        * Surfaces with equatorial OH groups are hydrophilic 
    * Microfibril orientation determines the directionality of cell growt 
* Pectin 
    * Acidic polysaccharides containing galacturonic acid residues
    * Homogalacturonan = α-1,4-lined chains of galacturonic acid sometimes decorated with xylose or apiose 
    * Methylation – homogalacturonan can be methylesterified at C6 carboxyl groups of galcturonic acid residues 
        * “Homogalacturonan crosslinking by calcium is enabled by demethylesterification of galacturonic acid residues by pectin methylesterases (PMEs) in the wall, and a cycle of calcium binding and unbinding might allow for remodeling of the pectin network in expanding, and even contracting, cells” (Anderson & Kieber 2020) 
    * Acetylation – homogalacturonan can be acetylated at O2 and O3 of galacturonic acid residues 
    * Rhamnogalacturonan I = alternating galacturonic acid and rhamnose residues, decorated with arabinan, galactan, and arabinogalactan side chains 
    * Rhamnogalacturonan II = homogalacturonan decorated with diverse sugar side chains and glycosyl linkages. 
    * Hydrophilic nature of pectin helps to reduce direct cellulose-cellulose contacts, which lubricates microfibril motions as cell wall expands (Cosgrove 2014) 
        * ssNMR data suggests that ~50% of cellulose surface is in contact with pectin (Dick-Perez et al 2012 / Mei Hong lab) 
    * Pectins may block access to cellulose surfaces, interact with xyloglucan and limit xyloglucan chains from aligning to hydrophobic surface of cellulose 
    * Cross-linking with Ca2+ influences cell wall properties 
    * “Egg-box” structure 
        * Degree of HG methylation influences how much cells can expand
        * HGs with low degree of methyl esterification (negative charge) can form Ca2+-mediated ionic cross-links to other HG molecules → cell wall stiffening → restriction of cell wall growth
        * Low DM HG forms 2<sub>1</sub> conformation egg box structures which have a two-fold screw conformation, which was observed via ssNMR (Temple et al 2022) 
            * However, reducing methylation by knocking out _gosamt1_ and _gosamt2_ resulted in an increase in the proportion of 2<sub>1</sub> egg boxes versus three-fold ones, as well as an increase in HG reducing ends, suggesting that when methylation is reduced, HG contains more and shorter egg box structures, and the HG backbone is more rigid 
            * Also, knockout of _gosamt1_ _gosamt2_ enhances the interaction between cellulose and two-fold xylan, perhaps due to increased gelling of the pectin (by forming egg box structures) 
    * Functions
        * Control of cell wall growth
            * Demethylesterification of pectin 
        * Role in specialised cell walls 
            * Pollen tubes 
        * Found in middle lamella and primary cell wall to contribute to cell adhesion, cell wall porosity, and flexibility
* Hemicelluloses – reinforce cell wall 
    * Bind to cellulose macrofibrils 
        * Structure of cellulose and hemicelluloses influences binding 
        * Hydrogen bonding to hydrophilic surface
        * Hydrophobic interactions with hydrophobic surface 
    * Regulate assembly of macrofibrils? 
    * Decorations reduces binding to cellulose macrofibrils? 
        * 
    * Cell expansion 
    * Mucilage adherence – glucomannan-cellulose interaction important for mucilage adherence to cellulose rays in _Arabidopsis _
    * Degree of branching?
    * Structure of hemicellulose regulates interactions with cellulose
    * Xyloglucan 
        * Backbone of glucan with xylose side chains that can be further substituted with galactose or fucose 
            * Xyloglucan side chains can “interdigitate” with cellulose microfibrils (Park & Cosgrove, 2015)? Pattern of substitution can affect this interaction. 
            * Too much substitution can lead to steric hindrance, while fewer substitutions means less hydrogen bonding → balance is needed. 
            * Type and order of substituents may depend on species, tissue type, cell type, developmental state of cell 
        * Xyloglucan may adopt a random coil shape rather than extended conformation, which limits its interaction with cellulose surfaces. Upon secretion, coiled xyloglucan binds immediately to the first bare cellulose surface it contacts. (Cosgrove 2014) 
        * Xyloglucan prefers to bind to hydrophobic surface of cellulose, while pectin prefers hydrophilic surface? – due to differences in overall interaction strength with each surface? E.g. pectin is charged, ion-dipole interactions are stronger than pd-pd interactions
        * Xyloglucan assumes a coiled shape, characteristic of most polymers, but are stiffer than highly flexible chains (e.g. dextran)  
        * Lopez et al (2010) used adsorption isotherms, isothermal titration calorimetry to find that binding capacity to cellulose seems to increase with the size of the xyloglucan, with minimum 12 glucosyl residues needed. Also found that fucosylation improves binding. 
            * However, computational analysis by Hanus and Mazeau (2006) enhanced binding from fucose was attributed to increase in OH groups available for hydrogen bonding rather than a property intrinsic to fucose. 
                * The general next step would be to add a random sugar with the same number of OH groups and in the same positions… Is this possible? 
        * Effect of substitutions 
            * One computational study by Levy et al (1991) suggested that terminal fucose residues promote xyloglucan binding to cellulose, and further biochemical experiments showed that fucosylated xyloglucan binds more rapidly to Avicel than non-fucosylated xyloglucan 
            * Acetylation of substituted glucose residues in xyloglucan in Poaceae, SOlanaceae improves xyloglucan solubility, preventing self-association and aggregation in xyloglucan variants with low substitution  
    * Formation of biomechanical hotspots 
        * E.g. xyloglucan may be intertwined with cellulose at these sites, or form a tight monomolecular junction between two more cellulose microfibrils
        * Not clear what atomic interactions mediate these hotspots 
    * Other functions
        * Act as a spacer polymer to prevent formation of cellulosic superaggregates
        * Adapter – helps cellulose interface with other wall matrix polymers 
* Xylan 
    * In xylan, removal of sugar substitution results in lignocellulose becoming more easily digested, suggesting that perhaps xylan links to lignin via MeGlcA? 
        * Even pattern of xylan substitution is important for cellulose binding 
    * The patterning of substitutions on xylan is also important for interaction with cellulose
        * “substitution of every other xylose in the xylan backbone with acetyl groups is thought to favor the adoption of a twofold helical screw conformation, allowing for binding to the hydrophilic surface of cellulose” (Anderson & Kieber 2020) 
        * A two-fold xylan ribbon with even spacing of decorations would have the decorations facing away from the hydrophilic surface of the cellulose fibril, while random spacing would obstruct the interaction 
        * Binding to hydrophobic surface of xylan does not need patterning, but also may involve flat xylan ribbons 
        * “Highly substituted xylans tend to be more soluble and have fewer direct interactions with cellulose, while less substituted xylans can form hydrogen bonds with cellulose, stabilizing the cell wall structure” 
* Most xylan is bound to hydrophilic cellulose surface in woody tissues, since most xylan is 2-fold → how does xylan coating affect recalcitrance to digestion, wall strength, extensibility? 
* Xylan usually forms a threefold conformation in solution, but flattens into a twofold helical screw ribbon to bind to  cellulose 	
    * As determined by ssNMR (Simmons et al 2016) 
* Even patterning of acetylation on xylan needed for its interaction with cellulose (Grantham et al 2016). When flattened into a twofold screw, decorations are oriented along one side of the molecule, so that non-decorated side of xylan can form hydrogen bonds with hydrophilic surface of cellulose  
    * Grantham et al (2016) used solid state NMR to investigate whether changing the acetylation pattern on xylan affects its interaction with cellulose. They found that in an _esk1_ _Arabidopsis_ (mutated in the xylan-specific acetyltransferase, ESKIMO1), the twofold screw signal for xylan was hardly detectable while the three-fold screw structure was more observed. The threefold xylan was observed to be more mobile, suggesting that interaction with cellulose is altered – more mobile xylan indicates it is less bound to cellulose 
* Callose is β-1,3-linked glucose subunits 
    * Synthesised only in specific developmental and environmental contexts 
    * Degraded soon after synthesis 
* Interactions between polysaccharides – no single polysaccharide can 100% recapitulate the behaviour of plant cell walls 
    * “ARABINOXYLAN PECTIN ARABINOGALACTAN PROTEIN (APAP1) glycoprotein (187) contains pectin and arabinoxylan domains that are covalently linked to a polypeptide core” (Anderson & Kieber 2020) 
    * “covalent linkages between pectins and xyloglucans have been detected in some cell walls” (Anderson & Kieber 2020) 
    * “Pectin-cellulose and pectinxylan complexes exist” (Anderson & Kieber 2020) 
    * But forces that drive these interactions are obscure – could be electrostatic, H bonding, VDW, hydrophobic/hydrophilic forces 
    * “evidence of close apposition between homogalacturonan and cellulose (46) points to potential direct interactions between homogalacturonan backbones, which are negatively charged, and cellulose microfibrils.” (Anderson & Kieber 2020) 
    * Pectin can interact with celluloses via hemicellulose– negatively charged pectin domains can form ionic/hydrogen bonds with hemicelluloses that in turn interact with cellulose (Scheller & Ulvskov 2010) ? 
    * Hemicelluloses can interact with cellulose via lignin – lignin forms covalent, non-covalent linkages with hemicellulose to anchor them to cellulose (Scheller & Ulvskov 2010) ?
    * In _Arabidopsis _primary cell walls, cellulose interacts extensively with pectins, while xyloglucan (the main hemicellulose)  has few cellulose cross-peaks from ssNMR, suggesting limited interaction. 
        * Two-network model –load-bearing is shared by all three types of polysaccharides rather than by XG-cellulose alone.  

Secondary cell wall and primary cell wall is different, and also diff plants and tissues have diff structures? 

Function is the same but property of cell wall is different. 

Effect of structure on breakdown 



* General comments 
    * Monosaccharides are very similar in conformation, CAZymes are often promiscuous. 
        * Other substituents may serve to indicate specificity
            * E.g. “BaMan5A, does not recognize O2 as a specificity determinant at any subsite distal to 21. Thus, while BaMan5A hydrolyzes only mannosidic bonds, the topographical features of the substrate-binding cleft of this enzyme are optimized to utilize glucomannan as its preferred substrate (Tailford et al., 2009)”
    * Due to polysaccharide interactions,  these interactions have to be broken apart for increased enzyme accessibility 
* Cellulose – recalcitrant to enzymatic digestion 
    * Cellobiohydrolases  remove cellobiose units. They act from the reducing end (CBH I) or the non-reducing end (CBH II). However, they can only access one face of the cellulose fibril and only at the free ends of chains, which limits the amount of substrate that can be digested 
        * Different enzymes from each end due to different chemistry required? 
    * Due to crystalline nature of cellulose, enzymes cannot cleave via hydrolysis, which requires free ends as there has to be an active site nucleophile on either side of the glycosidic bond for hydrolysis to occur. 
    * Instead, lytic polysaccharide monooxygenases (LPMOs) can do oxidative attack from just 1 side, allowing LPMOs to attack the crystalline cellulose. This might form more free ends for GHs to subsequently act on in a cascade. 
        * May also be able to act on amorphous cellulose  
* Xylan (and presumably other hemicelluloses) 
    * Decorations have to be removed by individual enzymes first 
        * E.g. glucuronyl residues removed with glucuronidase, galactose removed with galactosidase 
        * Enzymes have to act in order… algorithmic?
    * Backbone is digested to small oligosaccharides by an endoxylanase
    * Then β-xylosidase releases monosaccharides 
    * Branching structure makes it more soluble and more accessible to degradation than cellulose 
    * Breakdown of hemicelluloses can increase accessibility to cellulose to enzymatic degradation 
* Xyloglucan 
    * XyG may be in three regions – 1 domain is accessible to enzymes, 1 has limited accessibility as it is attached to cellulose microfibrils, and 1 is not accessible as it is “engulfed” by cellulose microfibrils 
* Pectin
    * Degree of methylation 
        * Low DM HG are substrates for polygalacturonase enzymes in plants. 
    * “Microbes produce pectinolytic enzymes, such as polygalacturonases, pectin lyases, and pectin methylesterases, to break down pectin. The cleavage of pectin can disrupt the integrity of the cell wall, making cellulose and hemicellulose more accessible to degradation.”
* Lignin – not polysaccharide, but is a barrier 
* Complex architecture makes cell wall breakdown difficult – microbes have to be able to synthesise a whole complement of enzymes 
    * E.g. Gut _Bacteroidetes_ have a large number of Polysaccharide Utilisation Locus (PUL) to respond to different polysaccharides 
* Evolution of carbohydrate binding modules (CBMs) for more effective targeting of enzyme to polysaccharide 
* A certain order to microbial breakdown is probably needed… somewhat algorithmic. 

Conclusions 

* Many ideas about cell wall structure have been influenced by in vitro experiments that are not necessarily representative the in vivo cell wall, whose structure has to contend with the effects of polymer crowding, entanglement, competing interactions and enzymatic modification (Cosgrove 2014) 
* Need more studies. We don’t know much about beta mannans, and about pectin function for example.
* “The complex and dynamic nature of these polysaccharides presents a challenge for microbial enzymes, which have evolved to target specific linkages and structures. Microbial degradation of plant cell walls is a concerted process involving multiple enzymes working together to release sugars, and the accessibility of these polysaccharides to the enzymes is a critical factor in determining the efficiency of the breakdown process.” 
* Implications for processing for biofuels. 
* Different plant species have different proportions of each plant cell wall polysaccharide, resulting in different properties that are evolved to adapt to their local environment
