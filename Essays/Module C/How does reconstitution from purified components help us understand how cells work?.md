**How does reconstitution from purified components help us understand how cells work?**

# Value of reconstitution 
- Reconstitution allows us to test our understanding of mechanisms – we can control for most errors compared to in vivo experiments.
- Understand the minimal components required for a particular process -> create a minimal model that can be more easily understood than the in vivo process. Can be used to understand the functions of each component by seeing what the effect of removing a component is on the process. 

## Examples for processes 
- SNARE-pin
	- Cracked PC12 assay 
- GET1/2 pathway 
- Sec61 translocation model 
- EMC translocation model 
	- Tsai et al (2022) – filopodia formation 
- CCR4-NOT complex reconstitution
	- Order of binding for complexes
		- Pre-initiation complex of Pol II – but it can be wrong, alternative models suggested by in vivo experiments
			- Translation initiation factors
		- Allows to study intermediate states with non-hydrolysable analogues
		- Role of various IFs as well 
	- Do deadenylation assays without CAF1/CCR4/PAN2/3 
- Identify components required for LLPS 
- WASP/Myosin complex for clathrin-mediated endocytosis 

## Examples for structural biology 
- Complexes need to be reconstituted in vitro for XRC, cryoEM, NMR – a way to arrive at mechanistic molecular detail
- Use mutations to confirm catalytic residues/important domains for interaction 

## Examples for enzyme activity 
- LPMO catalytic mechanism – monooxygenase or peroxygenase? 
- Optical tweezers for motor protein characterisation 
- Hunt for flippase/scramblase e.g. Verchere et al (2021)

# Disadvantages
- Using reconstituted systems can introduce other biases and errors – highly purified, synthetic system is not representative of cells. 
- If full system from cells is not correctly reconstituted, could result in a false outcome that is not representative of what is in the cell
	- E.g. COPI and COPII reconstitution findings contested with a COPII making a bottleneck-like structure data from in vivo microscopy experiments
	- E.g. What's enough for basal transcription in vitro vs. In cell
		- In vitro, Pol II and GTFs sufficient for basal transcription, but in vivo Mediator complex is also needed for efficient transcription 
- Loss of compartmentalisation 
- Findings need to be verified *in vivo* as *in vitro* systems could be too simplistic
