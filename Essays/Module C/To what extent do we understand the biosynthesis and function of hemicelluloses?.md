**To what extent do we understand the biosynthesis and function of hemicelluloses?**

Generally we understand xylans much more than other hemicelluloses. 

Mannans difficult to study because they are more abundant in gymnosperms, which are not genetically tractable and are difficult to grow in a lab (cf angiosperms which has _Arabidopsis_ as a model species) 

*Experimental evidence important 

*Organise by research question!!! 

# **Introduction**

* What are hemicelluloses
* Why is studying hemicelluloses important 
* Thesis statement 

# **Biosynthesis**

Main backbone is synthesised by cellulose synthase-like enzymes or IRX 

Backbone decorations are made by different glycosyltransferases 

Synthesis takes place in Golgi 
* Biosynthetic enzymatic activity present in microsomal fractions enriched with Golgi membranes
* Detection via immunolabeling of hemicelluloses in Golgi 

## Xylan

* Brief explanation of xylan structure 
* Xylan biosynthesis components not clear 
* How is the backbone of xylan synthesised? – xylan is unique in that backbone is synthesised by GTs 1 transmembrane anchor or with no transmembrane region, rather than multipass proteins (CSL family) 
    * Genetic screens in _Arabidopsis_ identified 3 groups of GTs involved in backbone synthesis. Not all have been fully characterised biochemically 
        * IRX9 – function unclear, no demonstrated enzymatic function _in vitro_
        * IRX14 – function unclear, no demonstrated enzymatic function _in vitro_
            * Maybe IRX9 and 14 stimulate IRX10 activity? 
                * Tobacco microsomes expressing asparagus IRX10 with 9 and 14 have higher xylan xylosyltransferase activity than if only 1 or 2 of these proteins were expressed (Zeng et al 2016) 
        * IRX10 (Jensen et al 2014) and IRX10L (Urbanowicz et al 2014) – biochemically characterised and confirmed to have the xylosyltransferase activity for backbone synthesis _in vitro_ 
            * In vivo, shown to form a xylan synthase complex  (XSC) with IRX9 and 14 
        * Identified from genetic screens – mutants in these genes have irregular xylem phenotype; xylan is involved in secondary walls in _Arabidopsis_, so xylan deficiency compromises xylem load bearing ability 
        * Also not clear which genes are redundant 
            * IRX10 and IRX10-like probably be redundant, e.g. _Selaginella_ and _Physcomitrium_ only have 1 IRX10/IRX10L ortholog
        * Not clear on mechanism of how the three work together in XSC for xylan synthesis – hypotheses are synthesis initiation, substrate acquisition, anchor xylan backbone, scaffold other biosynthetic enzymes. 
    * Initiation of biosynthesis of backbone is also not clear 
        * Tetrasaccharide thought to be primer, but xylans in grasses, bryophytes, seedless vascular plants lack this sequence. Could be initiated using short xylooligomer as primer or via de novo synthesis 
            * (why is a primer needed in the first place…?) 
* Sidechains 
    * Ara_f_T predicted from expression data 
        * α(1→2)-ArafT known – see Anders et al (2012) RNAi of wheat endosperm reduces Ara on wheat-flour xylan
        * α(1→3)-ArafT known 
        * α-Ara_f_T not known 
    * α(1→2)-GlcAT – no candidate proposed yet 
    * Hydroxycinnamate esters (e.g. ferulate, p-coumaryl) 
        * Feruloyl transferases are not known. 
        * Unclear what the mechanism of esterification is – the hydroxycinnamates may be transferred onto Araf on xylan in Golgi, or the donor could be added to the hydroxycinnamate then transported into the Golgi 
    * Acetyl groups 
        * Xylan O-acetyltransferases (XOATs) 
    * Glucuronyltransferases 
        * GUXs have been identified and biochemically characterised 
        * But unknown how the GUXs effect the GlcA distribution patterns on xylan 
            * _Arabidopsis _xylan has evenly spaced GlcA substitutions in “major domains” and evenly- and oddly-spaced ones in “minor domains” 
    * Glycosyl substitutions in grass xylan 
        * Xylan in grass has a different structure 
        * Grass xylan is substituted with 3-O-Araf by xylan 3-O-arabinosyltransferases in GT61 family 
* For conifers and some dicots, the reducing end of xylan molecules has a unique tetrasaccharide structure not found in xylans from grasses, bryophytes, seedless vascular plants 
    * Unclear how many GTs needed to make this oligosaccharide 
    * Candidate genes have been identified for each component of the oligosaccharide, from genetic screens, but no candidates have yet been identified for the rhamnosyltransferase. 
        * Biochemical characterisation is needed. 
    * This oligosaccharide may be important in biosynthesis, but function is unclear 
        * Primer – since synthesis of polysaccharides occurs via transfer to non-reducing end 
        * Terminator – Oligosaccharide is added last at R end to cap the polysaccharide. But this would require that xylan is synthesised from NR to R, instead of from R to NR in other hemicelluloses 
            * Irx7 and irx8 mutants (involved in synthesis of this oligo) have unusually long xylan molecules 
            * Also, the oligosaccharide is absent in grass xylan. If oligo is a primer, then xylan cannot be produced? 
            * But xylooligosaccharides can be modified at the reducing end e.g. by attachment of fluorescent tags, and they are still acceptors for xylan synthase, suggesting they are synthesised by transfer to NR end 
* Transporters 
    * Transporters for UDP-sugars have been identified 
    * However, need to identify a transporter for Arap out of the Golgi. UDP-Ara_p_ is converted from UDP-Xyl by the action of UDP-Xyl 4-epimerase in the Golgi. However, it then needs to be transported out into the cytosol to be converted by UDP-Ara mutase into UDP-Ara_f_. This is then used for arabinosyltransferases 

## Xyloglucan 

* Structure – beta-1,4-glucan that is substituted with a wide variety of residues 
* Many enzymes identified in _in vitro_ assays involving microsome extraction of enzymes, incubating microsomes with radioactively-labelled nucleotide sugars, then characterising the products 
* Backbone
    * Arabidopsis CSCL4 – beta(1->4)-glucan synthase confirmed to be involved in XyG biosynthesis 
        * 4 other CSLC members may have a role as well (1-3, 5) 
        * Expression of _Arabidopsis_ CSLC in methylotrohic yeast _Pichia pastoris_ resulted in formation of beta-1,4-linked glucan oligos in cell lysate 
* Xylose sidechains 
    * XXT1 
    * XXT2 
    * XXTs were identified via a candidate gene approach 
        * 1. XXT activity from pea microsome and fenugreek GMGT both observed to have a similar chemical activity whereby both add sugar moieties to O-6 of backbone sugars
        * 2. Since GMGT is in GT34 family, Faik et al tested GT34s from _Arabidopsis_ for XXT activity by recombinant expression in _Pichia pastoris_ yeast. This produced oligoglucan-dependent xylosyltransferase activity 
    * Genetic studies – KOs result in defects in XyG xylosyl substitution 
    * But atm we don’t know how the substitution patterns in XYG are generated 
        * Why XXGG vs XXXG? Specificity does not seem to be determined by the XXT enzymes themselves, since _Arabidopsis_ with only XXT1 (_xxt2 xxt5_ mutant) or only XXT2 (_xxt1 xxt5_) can produce XXXG pattern 
        * But also see Culbertson et al – binding pocket in XXT5 allows for closer spacing of xylosyl substitutions. 
        * Substitution pattern could be affected by acetylation. When a heterologous xyloglucan acetyltransferase (_Brachypodium distachyon _XyBAT) was transformed into _Arabidopsis_, the transgenic plants contained some XXGG instead of XXXG 
* Galactosyltransferase for second xylose in XXXG (_mur2_) 
    * Unclear which enzyme incorporate galactose on the second position of repeating unit 
        * Li et al (80) identified a GT in subgroup A of GT47 as responsible, but not confirmed which particular one; there are 10 members in this subgroup. 
* Galactosyltransferase for third xylose in XXXG (_mur3_) 
    * Biochemically characterised – in vitro assay of heterologously expressed protein `
    * GT47 
* Fucosyltransferase
    * Purified from pea via a biochemical approach 
    * Arabidopsis ortholog expressed and assayed _in vitro_
    * Genetic approach – fucose-deficient _Arabidopsis_ mutant _mur2_ has a mutation in the same gene
    * Specific to third galactose in repeating XXXG unit of xyloglucan 
        * _Arabidopsis_ mutant _mur3_ was fucose-deficient as it was mutated in XyG beta-(1->2)-galactosyltransferase; without galactose, cannot fucosylate 
* Acetylation of galactosyl from acetyl-CoA 
    * Acetyltransferases and acetyl-CoA transporters have yet to be identified 

## Mannan

* Backbone – only mannose or glucose and mannose 
    * CSLA in land plants 
    * beta-GGM – what determines the alternation?
* Sidechains
    * Galactose 
        * MAGTs 
            * Not yet characterised in lower land  plants (lmao) 
            * What determines their substrate specificity 
            * What determines pattern of galactosylation 
    * Acetyl groups
        * MOATs

## Remaining questions about biosynthesis. 
* Evolutionary origin of biosynthetic enzymes 
* Regulation of biosynthesis. What determines what side chains are added? 
* Have all UDP-sugar importers been identified? 
* Structure determination of biosynthetic components and how they contribute to biosynthesis 
    * Many GTs lack structures (!) e.g. GT43, GT47s involved in xylan backbone synthesis 
    * Important to understand CAZyme specificity… (see my project lol) 
    * ! We do not know how structures of the GTs affect their donor and substrate specificities ! 
* Functions of many GTs still unclear! 
* Also many gaps in parts of the phylogenetic tree, Arabidopsis used as model plant but haven’t investigated the function of the enzymes in other model plant species ?
* Exact location of the biosynthetic enzymes within the Golgi is unknown. 
    * Compartmentalisation can regulate the specificity of the enzymes, as it is known that CAZymes are often non-specific 
        * E.g. Some studies using antibodies against backbone or fucosyl residues in XyG found that backbone synthesis occurs in _trans _Golgi compartment, while fucosylation is initiated in _trans_ Golgi compartment but mainly in _trans_ Golgi network. But other studies suggest that synthesis begins in _cis_ Golgi with side chains added as XyG moves through Golgi 
* Not clear what regulates the patterns of substitutions on the backbones of hemicelluloses 
* Another reason it is challenging to identify the enzymes involved is because _in silico_ prediction of protein function can sometimes be inaccurate 
    * E.g. _in silico_ phylogenetic analysis of AtFUT1 designated it as a XyG:fucosyltransferase, but expression of rice FUT1-encoding gene in _Arabidopsis_ did not result in XyG fucosylation, yet expressing a different GT37 gene did 

# **Function**

Hemicelluloses have various functions. 

Structures are known, how to relate structure to function? 

Hemicelluloses partially coat cellulose microfibrils – this may be to modulate interactions between cellulose fibrils. At hot spots of cellulose interactions, hemicellulose can affect these interactions. May be involved in assembly of secondary cell wells 

* Main role is to tether cellulose microfibrils -> strength cell wall 
* E.g. Yu et al (2022) – cellulose is disorganised in mutant _Arabidopsis_ that lack XyG and beta-GGM 

## Xylan

* Even pattern of decoration allows it to bind flush to the hydrophilic surface of cellulose
* Linking to lignin via ferulate esters 

## Mannan 

* Important for formation of new cell walls 
    * AtMAGT1 one of the most expressed GTs in shoot apical meristem -> GGMs may be important to the initial deposition and re-generation of primary cell walls 
        * Peaucelle et al (2020) – Super-resolution microscopy showed growing deposits of beta-mannans during early cell plate formation 
    * But why mannan and not other hemicelluloses? 
* Important for seed development 
    * _Csla7_ mutant arrested in early embryo formation 
    * But _csla239_ triple mutant develops normally even though it only has trace amounts of beta-mannans in stem 
        * So some beta mannans not as essential? 
* Important for seed mucilage architecture
    * Glucomannan is essential for mucilage adherence to cellulose rays in _Arabidopsis_
        * Yu et al 2018, 2022 
* Seed storage carbohydrates
* _Arabidopsis _development
    * _CSLA7_ impairs pollen function 

## Xyloglucan 

* In xyloglucan, the presence of a substitution on the third xylosyl position is important for normal function in plant growth, but the type of substituent can vary -> XyG can have diverse substituents 
    * E.g. when XyG:arabinofuranosyltransferase (SIXST1) was transformed into an _Arabidopsis mur3 xlt2_ double mutant (which lacks galactose on XyG), arabinofuranosyl residues were added to the third xylose. This rescued the dwarf phenotype of the double mutant 
* Role in plant cell walls is to interact with cellulose 
* Source of signalling molecules (minor role) 
    * Breakdown products of XyG (e.g. XXFG) counteract auxin-induced cell expansion 

Deletion of hemicelluloses _in vivo _by deleting genes involved in their biosynthesis, or reconstitution _ex vivo_? 

Solid state NMR has been key to elucidating interactions between hemicellulose and cellulose 

## Functional relationship between hemicelluloses and cellulose

# Remaining questions about hemicelluloses. 
* What determines the composition of different hemicelluloses in different clades? 
    * E.g., Why are there more mannans in gymnosperms and more xylans in angiosperms? 
* We are missing MECHANISMS – how does the structure of each hemicellulose relate to their function? 
    * Unlike proteins, monosaccharides are more similar in structure, some are epimers 

# **Conclusion**
* Engineering cell walls
* Production of biofuels or more easily processed gymnosperm wood
