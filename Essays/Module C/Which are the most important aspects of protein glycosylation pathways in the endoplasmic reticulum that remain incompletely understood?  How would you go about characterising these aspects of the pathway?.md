Which are the most important aspects of protein glycosylation pathways in the endoplasmic reticulum that remain incompletely understood?  ==*How would you go about characterising these aspects of the pathway?

# Not understood 
- Flippase identities 
- Regulation of LLO synthesis (dolichol recycling?)
- Why need to use dol as a donor, why bipartite model (how does it benefit cell) if Leloir nucleotides are also present in ER lumen (e.g. UDP-Glc)
	- Could be that use of Dol-P linked monosaccharides by ER localised GTs reflects prokaryotic origins of N-glycosylation pathway? 
	- In prokaryotes, O-antigen biosynthesis, murein biosynthesis and arabinomannan biosynthesis in Mycobacteria involve flipping of glycolipid across membranes ![[Pasted image 20230531220613.png]]
- How is OST substrate specificity determined
