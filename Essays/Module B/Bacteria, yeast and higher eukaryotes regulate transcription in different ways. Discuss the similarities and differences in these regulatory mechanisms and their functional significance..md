**Bacteria, yeast and higher eukaryotes regulate transcription in different ways. Discuss the similarities and differences in these regulatory mechanisms and their functional significance.**

# By the numbers... 

| Criteria                      | E. coli | Human     |
| ----------------------------- | ------- | --------- |
| Genome size                   | 9 Mbp   | 3.2 Gbp   |
| Number of genes               | 9 000   | 25 000    |
| Ratio of genes to genome size | 1:1000  | 1:128 000 | 

# Challenges
## Common to all
- Accurate initiation
- Transcription must be terminated at some point
- TEmporal regulation 

## Eukaryotic-specific challenges
- Managing chromatin 
- Regulation is more complex
- Presence of introns/exons 

# Regulatory mechanisms 

![[Bacteria, yeast and higher eukaryotes regulate transcription in different ways. Discuss the similarities and differences in these regulatory mechanisms and their functional significance.pdf]]

# Functional significance 
- CTD – links transcription to downstream RNA processing
- Splicing –  greater combinatorial sets of diversity generated through a single transcript
- Enhancers and 3D genome architecture allow for specific regulation of gene expression e.g. in the course of differentiation
- Initiation as the predominant step for regulation
- Ppportunity for differential regulation in eukaryotes due to heterogeneity in regulatory elements, trans factors involved in transcription of different genes in different contexts
