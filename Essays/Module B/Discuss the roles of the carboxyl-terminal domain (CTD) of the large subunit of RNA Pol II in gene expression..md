# Intro
The large subunit Pol II CTD is formed of heptad repeats of consensus YSPTSPS. It is unique to eukaryotes and Pol II within eukaryotes, with the number of repeats roughly correlating to genome complexity (Egloff et al., 2012). The propensity for consensus decreases towards the C-terminus. While not necessary for _in vitro_ transcription, a minimum CTD length is essential for viability in all eukaryotes corresponding to roughly half the WT number, likely due to its role as a programmable binding hub in transcription.

Each amino acid in a repeat can reversibly take 2 distinct structural forms as shown by figure 1, creating 2^7 potential states per heptad and even greater potential across the multi-repeat tail. The role of the coding can be seen at the earliest stage of gene expression; in initiation, TFIIE and TBP bind with high affinity to unphosphorylated CTD, with the transition to elongation prompted by S2 phosphorylation reducing the binding affinity for the GTFs. This demonstrates the importance of the CTD as a variable binding platform during the gene expression process enabling recruitment of different factors suited for different stages, which will be explored in the following sections. 

# Capping

As soon as the nascent RNA transcript protrudes from Pol II, an N7-methylguanosine cap is attached to the 5’ end of the mRNA via a 5’-5’-triphosphate bond. As reported in the review by Ramanathan (2016), this cap serves to facilitate translation initiation, as well as being involved in cytoplasmic export and splicing of proximal introns. This capping processing is catalysed by a bifunctional enzymatic complex with RNA triphosphatase and RNA guanylyltransferase activities. This complex was shown to only associate with the Rbp1 CTD and not the other subunits of Pol II via co-immunoprecipitation experiments (Cho et al., 1997). Furthermore, affinity chromatography was used by Cho and Shuman to illustrate that two heptad repeats of Ser-5-P are needed for RGTase binding, and the amount of RGTase bound correlates with the number of repeats present. This has also been confirmed by experiments in fission yeast whereby Ser5 to Ala mutants are not viable, but viability is restored by fusing enzymes to the Rpb1 CTD, implying that the sole purpose of the CTD is to facilitate capping, although this contradicts other evidence whereby the CTD is involved in splicing and 3’ end processing (Schwer and Schuman, 2011). Interestingly, more recent discoveries have uncovered a novel binding site on the surface of the RGTase for the CTD which facilitates allosteric activation of the enzyme, illustrating how the CTD is not only responsible for the recruitment of the factors involved in capping, but also for activation of these factors too (Bage et al., 2021). 

# Promoter proximal pausing

CTD also affects gene expression through regulating enzymes involved in RNA Pol Il promoter proximal pausing. The ChIP experiment revealed high Ser5-P and Ser7-P levels and low Ser2-P level at the proximal promoter region, but low Ser5-P and Ser7-P levels and higher Ser2-P level towards the 3’ end (Lu et al., 1992) (Fig. 2). While the ChIP analysis revealed the intimate relationship between the CTD phosphorylation and regulation, the exact mechanism and proteins involved have not been fully identified. One of the well characterised proteins is the positive transcription elongation factor b (P-TEFb), where Ser2 phosphorylation by P-TEFb antagonises the negative elongation factors such as NELF and promotes the release from pausing. Still, the necessity of the reduced Ser5-P and Ser7-P and higher Ser2-P for Pol II release was unclear as multiple genetic experiments knocking out the kinases involved in CTD phosphorylation failed to abolish mRNA production. These results are probably due to the adaptive rewiring or evolution of mutant strain; for example, the compensation of kinase knockdown through the downregulation of phosphatase activity (Aoi et al., 2020). Adopting more rapid strategies such as small molecule inhibitors or auxin-inducible degron system would enable investigation of the proteins involved in pausing without triggering adaptive rewiring.

# Splicing

The CTD is likely to be involved in splicing as well, by acting as a landing platform that recruits various spliceosome components onto the growing pre-mRNA. Such factors include polypyrimidine tract binding protein-associated splicing factor, U2AF65, and Mud1. The CTD may be particularly amenable to such multivalent interactions due to its repeat regions, which provide multiple binding sites for interaction. 

One phosphoisoform of RNA Pol II that has been implicated in splicing is CTD Ser5-P (S5P). Using ChIP that targets S5P, Ser5 has been found to be increasingly phosphorylated towards the 3’ splice site of exons. This process may be mediated by kinases such as P-TEFb. S5P has also been shown to directly interact with U1 spliceosome components in yeast (e.g. Mud1), and likely recruits them to the 3’ splice site. In one experiment, Harlen et al. (2016) used a modified ChIP technique known as ChIP-nexus to demonstrate that the level of Mud1 occupancy and Ser5 phosphorylation coincide exactly around the 3’ splice site of high U1 occupancy genes. S5P levels then decrease as RNAP II translocates further away from the 3’ splice site, presumably via the action of some phosphatase e.g. Rtr1. 

The Thr4 phosphorylated (T4P) isoform may also be involved in splicing, albeit post-transcriptionally. This is because Thr4P does not appear to interact with spliceosome subunits, yet replacement of Thr4 with valine in all 26 residues of the yeast CTD resulted in a 2-fold increase in intron retention for 38% of genes investigated (Harlen et al., 2016). 

# 3’ end processing

 As RNA Pol II elongates, the CDK9 subunit of P-TEFb catalyses the phosphorylation of Ser-2 on the CTD. Consistent with the role of the CTD as a scaffold for RNA processing factors, the cleavage stimulation factor (CstF) and the cleavage and polyadenylation specificity factor (CPSF) both bind the CTD with a high affinity for phosphorylated Ser-2 (Figure below). The dependence of 3’ end processing on Ser2-P by P-TEFb was shown in Drosophila using flavopiridol, a highly specific P-TEFb kinase inhibitor (Ni et al., 2004). This altered 3’ end processing, with defects in RNA cleavage. The CTD also plays an important role in the 3’ end processing of other RNAs. For example, snRNA 3’ end processing relies on the Integrator complex, which is recruited to the CTD via Ser2-P and Ser7-P. Mutating Ser7 to Ala caused defects in 3’ end processing of snRNPs, but not polyadenylated mRNA. This highlights how the simple heptad repeat can be read by a huge number of factors through combinatorial power.

# Phase separation

The distribution of the polymerase within the nucleus is not uniform and gene expression is promoted by the local clustering of RNA polymerase II around active genes via liquid-liquid phase separation (LLPS). While the CTD is intrinsically disordered and lacks defined secondary structures like the rest of the polymerase, as can be shown by circular dichroism, the repeating units can form interactions with each other in vitro forming phase separated clusters. Using fluorescent and differential interference microscopy Zweckstetter et al. have demonstrated that phase separation occurs in a concentration dependent manner and that phase separation increases as the number of repeats in the CTD increase as well, but phosphorylation of the CTD causes the LLPS droplets to dissociate. Phosphorylation of CTD Ser5 is sufficient for dissolution of the cluster. From this they proposed that unphosphorylated pol II forms LPSS clusters and after recruitment to the PIC, ser5 of the CTD is phosphorylated to allow for efficient elongation and also liberates pol II from its cluster. However, whether LPSS occurs in vivo under physiological conditions requires further investigation but it is likely that the CTD acts to increase the local concentration of pol II around active genes though phase separation facilitating an increased rate of PIC assembly. Alternatively, the CTD mediated localised clustering of RNA pol II around active genes could help prevent the transcription of inactive or silenced genes, imposing an additional spatial level of regulation for initiation specificity.

# Conclusion

Evidently, RNA Pol II CTD is vital in coordinating a multitude of different facets of the gene expression process from transcription itself to RNA processing and the interplay between the two. Genetic analyses, structural studies and a number of hallmark ChIP experiments have elucidated many of the key features of the Pol II CTD and its modifications, helping to characterise many of its important functions. However, a holistic and exhaustive understanding of the functional application of this domain remains unachieved. Key questions in the field pertain to the potential of additional post-translational modifications such as ubiquitination and methylation in CTD regulation, and the gene specific perturbations to the general model of CTD modification which could provide for more nuanced regulation of gene expression. Additionally, it will be important to further characterise the full repertoire of CTD kinases and their precise function, especially since many of these enzymes are implicated in cancer development and viral infections such as HIV and Influenza.
