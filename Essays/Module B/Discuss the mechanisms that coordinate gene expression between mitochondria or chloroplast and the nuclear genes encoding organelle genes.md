**Discuss the mechanisms that coordinate gene expression between mitochondria/chloroplasts and the nucleus/nuclear genes encoding chloroplast/mitochondrial genes.**

The Churchman lab investigated whether nuclear and mitochondrial-encoded oxidative phosphorylation genes are simultaneous co-regulated at the transcriptional level in _S. cerevisiae_. They switched the yeast to a nonfermentable carbon source (to engage OXPHOS), and then analysed the rate at which transcripts from nucleus vs mt accumulated. They found that transcripts from both sources increase following the carbon shift, but nuclear transcripts increased at a faster rate, suggesting that transcription is not coordinated (at least on a short timescale). As such, downstream mechanisms are more likely to play a role. 

Yeast translation was then analysed using ribosome profiling, and the group found that both cytosolic and mitochondrial ribosomes prefer mRNAs encoding OXPHOS Complex III and IV subunits over those encoding ATPase synthase subunits 



* Mechanisms that coordinate the translation programs are currently unknown 

(Couvillion et al 2016) 

Nuclear encoded translational activators 



* Ribosome profiling data from cytosol suggest that translational activators are upregulated when yeast are shifted from glucose to glycerol-containing media (Couvillion et al 2016) 
* In humans, unclear how translational programmes are coordinated because many mammal mRNA contain a very short (&lt;4-nt) or no 5â€™ UTR 

Superstoichiometric production of mitochondrial subunits 



* If subunits have low affinities for interaction, overproducing subunits could increase the encounter rate between subunits, thus increasing the rate of assembly 
* Overproduction could be protective by preventing other toxic subunits or intermediates from accumulating 
    * E.g. in absence of Cox2, mitochondria assemble a partial Complex 4 that is toxic to the cell; the production of excess subunits downstream of partially assembled complex IV could facilitate assembly of a less toxic intermediate 

Conclusion 



* Remaining questions 
    * How is the nucleus and mitochondria coordinated in different contexts e.g. stress, development, disease
