**Discuss the functional importance of properly regulated alternative pre-mRNA splicing.**

# Intro 

* pre-mRNA splicing is a prevalent mechanism of protein expression regulation across the eukaryotes 
* Species have evolved complex regulatory networks that 
* Proper regulation of pre-mRNA splicing ensures that the correct combination of exons is joined to produce a functionally relevant isoform 

# Regulation of pre-mRNA splicing is important. 

## Proper regulation of pre-mRNA splicing is important because splice sites contain insufficient information to specify their recognition 

* In higher eukaryotes (e.g. mammals), recognition of splice sites depends on a system of regulatory mechanisms that modulate the efficiency at which exons are spliced, thus determining the frequency of each protein isoform 
* [[Discuss the evidence that helped to address the problem of the “information deficit” in mammalian consensus splice site sequences]]

## pre-mRNA splicing is an important regulatory mechanism for genes involved in development 

* Proper regulation is required to ensure that only productive isoforms are produced
* Improper regulation can have systemic consequences for the individual, exemplified by how mutations that affect splicing often lead to disease
    * Mutations in splicing factors
        * Cancer Genome Project – mutations in numerous SR proteins have been linked to specific cancer types, e.g. U2AF1, SRSF2
            * Mechanism of tumourigenesis unclear though 
    * Mutations in cis elements
        * Progeria
        * E.g. HRAS has two splice variants, one that includes an exon named IDX and one that doesn’t. The dominant isoform of wt HRAS contains IDX exon, which contains a premature termination codon (PTC) that targets the transcript for NMD, thus limiting HRAS expression. Barbier et al (2007) showed that this transcript was subject to NMD by blocking the NMD pathway with cycloheximide and siRNAs against NMD pathway components, and observed accumulation of the transcript. 
            * IDX exon and flanking introns are highly conserved in mammals 
            * Mutation in the 5’ splice site (as done by Cohen & Levinson, 1988) resulted in enhanced HRAS expression  
* Tissue-specific expression 
    * Rewiring protein-protein interactions
    * CNS expression 
        * Autism 
        * Some genes have thousands of exons, so proper regulation becomes crucial e.g. Dscam1
* Phenotypic plasticity – allow populations to adapt to their environment in a shorter period of time compared to evolution 
* Intron retention as a mechanism for gene expression regulation in _S. cerevisiae_ 

# Regulation is not important.

3. Dysregulation of alternative splicing could drive evolution (noisy splicing). 

[[What arguments support or oppose the biological importance of alternative splicing?#^a8bcab]]

# Conclusion 

* As alternative splicing is a key regulatory mechanism for many species in many instances, it should not be surprising that the process itself must be properly regulated 
    * For higher eukaryotes in particular, this regulatory process has to be even more complex to make up for the information deficit
* Recent data suggests that AS is not a widespread mechanism for generating protein diversity, and in turn regulation of AS may not be as important as once thought 
* However, numerous case studies of AS in regulation do show that regulation is at least key in a number of instances 
* Clinical applications
    * Therapeutics for correcting misregulation of splicing, e.g. Nusinersen, TSUNAMI (treated spinal muscular atrophy–like syndrome in a mouse model by altering SMN-2 pre-mRNA splicing patterns) 
* Ecological applications? (e.g. understanding how species can adapt to their environment)
