**How does the “promoter escape process” limit the rate of transcription by RNA polymerase II?**

# Why is there a need for promoter escape? 

* During early elongation, contacts between promoter DNA and GTFs can prevent the polymerase from moving forward
* Abortive initiation 
    * In the early stages of transcription, the RNA-DNA hybrid is not stably associated as then RNA is short. The RNA can dissociate which aborts initiation. 
        * If only the NTP complementary to the first nucleotide in the template is added, then RNAP II goes through multiple rounds of synthesis without further elongating. 
        * If Pol II is paused by leaving out one NTP, it tends to dissociate if it pauses in the first 10 bases of the nascent RNA 
* Slippage can also occur before promoter escape

# How does promoter escape occur? 

* In early elongation, RNA-DNA hybrid lengthens until 8 nt, downstream of which the RNA separates from the DNA and enters the polymerase exit channel
* However, this hybrid conformation is unstable and if the RNA Pol can extend beyond 10 nt of RNA, the upstream region of the bubble collapses, and the template and nontemplate DNA reassociate. 
    * After bubble collapse, TFIIH is not needed for elongation anymore 
    * The exact length the RNA has to be when the bubble collapses depends on where the upstream edge of the bubble starts. The bubble has to be 17-18 bases long. The location of the upstream edge of the bubble depends on the location of the TATA element. Mammalian TATA box is 28-33 bp away from +1 spacing. After 10 nucleotides of RNA are synthesised, there is about 18 bp of open bubble remaining
* RNAP II is assisted in extending beyond 10 nt by TFIIH 
    * Pol II is less prone to abortive initiation than prokaryotic RNAP
    * If XPB is inhibited, abortive initiation becomes more likely 
    * Helicase prevents template and nontemplate strands from reannealing which would expel the nascent RNA 
        * If templates are used that are mismatched in the region upstream of the TSS (the part that normally unwinds in the open complex), transcription can occur without abortive initiation independent of TFIIH (although synthesis does not continue beyond +15) 
* There are two models for how bubble collapse completes promoter clearance 
    * Model 1 – The energy released from the binding is used to push the polymerase onward, disrupt contacts between DNA and GTFs, allowing for promoter escape. 
    * Model 2 – DNA scrunching model. Upon initiation, in early elongation, polymerase stays where it is on the template and draws in downstream DNA during RNA synthesis (instead of moving along the DNA). The strain from scrunching is what drives abortive initiation. However, strain is eventually released to break the promoter contacts, thus allowing for clearance 
        * But this model was drawn from studies on bacterial RNA polymerase, which lacks helicase 
* However, in yeast, strong core promoter motifs can retain some PIC components even after RNAP escapes, and this lets them recruit new Pol II efficiently
    * So even if promoter escape limits rate of transcription by 1 RNAP II, it could facilitate further recruitment of more RNAP II 
* After promoter clearance, interaction between the longer RNA transcript and the exit channel helps to stabilise RNAP II on the DNA
* However, complexes that pause from +17 to +32 can backtrack sometimes, and they usually backtrack to the base with 12-13 bases remaining upstream 
    * Not known why this backtracking occurs 
* Pol II definitively gains the characteristics of a mature elongation complex once the transcript is beyond +30 

# Why does promoter escape limit rate of transcription 

* Blocks additional RNAP from binding to the promoter, decreasing transcription efficiency 
* RNAP II may remain associated with promoter via Mediator, so it may not actually ever “escape”. The advantage of this could be to allow for rapid reinitiation
