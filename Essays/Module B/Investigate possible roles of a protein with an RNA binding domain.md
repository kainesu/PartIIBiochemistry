**You have identified a mouse protein that you suspect to have a role in gene expression. The sequence of the protein contains a predicted RNA binding domain. Describe how you would set about investigating the possible roles of the protein in gene expression.**

# Identify RNA that protein interacts with 
- RNA -> region of RNA -> function of protein in gene expression 

- CLIP-Seq
- OOPS
- SELEX for RNA binding sequences
- RNA footprinting
- RNA EMSA
- NMR chemical shift 

# Function of protein 
- KO & overexpression -> see effect on gene expression in the cell – Mass spec and RNA-seq data 
- Can also knockout in a mouse itself e.g., if tissue, organ specific defects 
- In silico analysis of other domains in the protein – is it homologous to other proteins 
	- IDR present? -> if yes, potentially important for phase-separation & localisation to P-body
- Tethering assay (MS2-MCP) to verify its effect
	- Detect domains required for effect of this protein
	- What protein- protein interactions do the domain mediate
- AP-MS for potential interactors of the protein
	- Compare with homologues in databases
- Fuse to GFP for localization! 

# Structure of the protein 
- Cryo-EM/NMR for conformational changes
- PTMs
	- Relevance of PTMs to structure/function
