**How do phase separation and biomolecular condensates contribute to translational regulation?**

* Define phase separation 
* How does phase separation contribute to spatial translation 
    * Localisation of mRNA to condensates can set spatial distribution of mRNA 
* How does phase separation contribute to temporal regulation
    * Timing of translation initiation 
        * Under different conditions (stress v non-stress)
        * During the cell cycle 
    * Effect of phase separation on translation 
        * Translational repression 
        * Translational decay 
    * Post-translational modification can affect the composition of the condensate and also the effect on translational regulation
    * The effect of phase separation on translation is heterogeneous; different mRNAs are localised to condensates with differing efficiencies, those more localised to them more likely to be affected 
        * It also depends on the condensate
            * P-bodies – mRNA encoding regulators 
            * Stress granules – long, poorly translated mRNA 
    * Condensates are also dynamic structures so effect on translation is dynamic 
* Still many questions surrounding phase separation
