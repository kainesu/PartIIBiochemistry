**What are the outstanding mechanistic questions in understanding the translation of mRNA into protein, and how would you go about solving them?**

Structure: 
* State the question/issue
* Explain the background to the issue 
* Significance of resolving this issue 
* State a solution
* Explain how the solution would solve the question 
* Give an example of how the solution has been applied to a similar question 

General issues. 
* Disagreements between structural techniques studying the same process 
* Certain processes are too rapid 
* Poor understanding of dynamics – how complex shifts from one state to another

# **1. Unresolved conformational changes  **
* Different pathways of initiation 
    * Cryo-EM has captured different initiation complexes that suggest possible alternative pathways during initiation. 
        * E.g. Closed 30S-initiator tRNA-IF3 complex without IF1 has been captured by some Cryo-EM studies (Korostelev 2022), while other studies suggest that 30S interacts with IF1 and IF3 together, which do not dissociate until GTP hydrolysis by IF2
            * IF1 binds, dissociates, then binds again? 
            * Alternative parallel pathways of initiation? 
                * Could be a means of regulation 
    * Some structures have been captured in certain structural methods but not others. 
        * E.g. one Cryo-EM study captured a population of fully rotated 70S-initiator tRNA ribosomes with IF2 and non-hydrolysable GTP analog, which could not be found in solution smFRET or time resolved cryo-EM. These techniques instead found a different structure of the 70S-initiator tRNA-IF2 complex where there is partial rotation and partial head swivel (Korostelev, 2022) 
    * Solutions – cryo-EM under different conditions, time-resolved cryo-EM, time-resolved NMR, XFEL? 
* Translocation – states are highly  transient, hard to capture 
    * When does E-site tRNA leave the ribosome? 
        * E-site tRNA has to leave the ribosome as its presence would prevent the P-site tRNA from moving into the E-site
        * In the allosteric 3-site model, E-site tRNA affinity decreases when A site is occupied and vice-versa, so E-site tRNA may increase fidelity of A-site tRNA selection, and thus should only dissociate when the next aa-tRNA is brought to the ribosome 
        * But a single molecule study showed that dissociation of E-site tRNA is not concurrent with A-site tRNA arrival 
    * How triggers the ribosome to enter the hybrid state for translocation? Does it just sample this state, which is then recognise and stabilised by EF-G? 
    * Need true posttranslocational state structure
        * Structure obtained by Gao et al (2009) was formed by binding EF-G to ribosome with empty A site, so tRNA in E site is not cognate 
* Termination – challenging to study because it occurs rapidly 
    * Can use time-resolved cryo-EM 
    * How is RF activated by stop codon
    * How does RF dissociate after termination 

# **2. Purpose of components  **

* Why is there a 30S E site? 
    * 50S E site would be sufficient to stabilise hybrid state during translocation 
    * Some studies suggest that
        * “Release factors sense codon-anticodon mismatches in the E site” for some quality control mechanism 
            * Get structural data of release factors with E site containing codon-anticodon mismatch? 
        * Mutations in 30S E site do not affect fidelity, but affect frameshifting, so it appears to play a role in processivity during translocation 
            * Get this structure too, maybe time-resolved to compare how translocation occurs in such ribosomes with mutated E sites vs normal ribosomes 
* Roles of 30S rearrangements and IF3 in discrimination between cognate and near-cognate tRNA during initiation 
    * Compare structure of initiation complexes with cognate and near-cognate tRNAs 

# **3. Unresolved catalytic mechanisms **
* What is the role of A72 in peptidyl transfer? 
* How is GTP hydrolysis activated? 
    * Role of A2622 
    * Role of L7/L12
    * Homology to GAPs, look for hydrogen bond networks, interactions with catalytic sites of EF-Tu, etc.  
    * Get structure of GTPase activated form of ribosome bound to EF-G
        * Femtosecond serial XFEL? Could be fast enough to capture these structures 

# **4. Dynamics and kinetics **
* How does the ribosome progress from one state to another? 
    * Molecular dynamics 
    * NMR 
* Does translocation involve a power stroke, or is it a Brownian ratchet? 
    * A direct measurement of the forces generated would help 
    * E.g. from motor proteins 
    * Chen et al (2016) – single-molecule polarized fluorescence microscopy, suggests a hybrid model where translocation is initiated by a power stroke, and further steps by a Brownian ratchet mechanism

Time resolved cryo-ET, molecular dynamics would probably be useful 

Femtosecond XFEL? 

FRET
