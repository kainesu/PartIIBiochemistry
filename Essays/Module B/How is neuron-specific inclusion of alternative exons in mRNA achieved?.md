**How is neuron-specific inclusion of alternative exons in mRNA achieved?**

* Multiple mechanisms 
    * DSCAM (see other essay) 
    * CNS splicing code 
        * Position-dependence of some splicing regulatory factors 
        * Splicing enhancers 
            * E.g. microexons 
        * Neuron-specific expression of trans factors e.g. N1 exon 
            * Upregulation of activators 
            * Downregulation of suppressors (PTBP1) 
* AS in neuronal tissue is unique â€¦ 
    * Protein diversity for synaptic connections
* Importance 
    * Disorder e.g. autism
