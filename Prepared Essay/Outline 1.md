**Methane is a far more potent "greenhouse gas" than CO2. Can biochemistry assist in the long-term control of methane levels in the atmosphere?**

# Context 
- What is the effect of methane on the atmosphere
- How much more potent is it as a greenhouse gas than CO<sub>2</sub>
- A brief overview of the global methane budget – major sources and sinks 
- What is methane control, and why it is important to control the levels of methane in the atmosphere 
	- Precisely because it is more potent as a greenhouse gas that it may be more efficient to tackle global warming by removing methane, since each unit of methane contributes more to global warming over a timescale of X years than CO<sub>2</sub>
- To what level do we want to control methane at? 
- Methane levels in the atmosphere can either be controlled by 
	- Reducing primary methane emissions at the source 
	- Removing existing methane in the atmosphere 
	- #comment ==Methane has a short half-life, does this have any implication for methane control strategies? I think it affects the speed at which methane has to be removed from the atmosphere for solutions to be effective, but should check this out.==

- Various strategies exist for methane control, largely classified into biological, chemical, mechanical

- To evaluate the ability of biochemical solutions to achieve long-term methane control, we will consider the following parameters 
	- Effectiveness at reducing methane levels in the atmosphere (whether by reducing methane emissions or removing methane from the atmosphere)
	- Long-termism 
	- Economic cost
	- Environmental impact 
	- Immediacy (how soon can it be deployed in the field?)
	- Versatility/adaptability (?) – can it be used in different environments
	- Etc etc 

Include a nice summary picture here. 
I think it could be similar to the one in my EEC report on GHGs? That I reproduced from a paper. 

# Approaches 
## Reducing methane emissions
Solutions are ordered in terms of immediacy, so 
- Biochemical research on reducing methane emissions
- Applications currently undergoing testing 
- Applications being deployed in the field right now 

### Solution 1 
- Brief explanation of what the solution is
- How it works 
- Why it's good
- Why it's bad 
- Other considerations 
- Areas 

## Increasing methane removal 

# Areas for future research 
Overall we can see that there are some key gaps in the research that could improve biochemical solutions, such as
- Methanotroph strain engineering 
- Enzyme engineering (does immobilisation of purified enzymes on a solid matrix work? Or too unstable?)
- ...
- ... 

# Conclusion 
- Ultimately, reducing methane emissions in the first place will be essential to the long-term control of methane in the atmosphere, however because of economic and social difficulties in achieving sufficient methane emission reductions, technologies for methane removal may be necessary
