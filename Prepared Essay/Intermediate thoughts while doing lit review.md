Just based on what I have read so far, it may be that biochemical solutions may be viable for reducing emissions from certain methane sources but not others? In terms of economics. 

I also feel like the answer to the question is going to be that biochemistry can assist in the alleviation of methane emissions, but permanent reduction can only be achieved by stopping emissions at the source, which cannot be resolved biochemically (but rather through systemic changes, political/social change, etc.)

as some solutions are expensive, may need to add a note somewhere that governmental support is necessary for the adoption of these removal processes 

and, indicate what we *don't* yet know about these technologies as a proposal for future research and prospects to policymakers. E.g. X has great potential as shown by Researcher et al 2022 but needs more research for safety, long-term efficacy 

Given 3000 words, probably can't go into every single solution, but should discuss those that have most potential for long-term methane conrol. 

## Context 
[[SaunoisEtAl_2020]] – Global Methane Budget 2000-2017

A lot of the articles I'm reading are quite recent! Seems like research into methane is getting a lot of attention. 

## Solutions
### Reviews 
[[JacksonEtAl_2021]] is quite a significant paper. It references  a lot of existing research on biochemical solutions. Should definitely take the time to read these solutions. 

[[Nisbet-JonesEtAl_2022]] 

[[MingEtAl_2022]]

[[SmithEtAl_2021]] – proposes biochemical solutions to enteric fermentation 

[[ReisingerEtAl_2021]] – further biochemical solutions for enteric emissions 

[[HristovEtAl_2013]] – more details on solutions for enteric emissions.

[[LaEtAl_2018]] – review on biofiltration of methane 

Would be useful to create a table of criteria comparing the solutions. Comparing biochemical solutions to non-biochemical solutions, and also between biochemical solutions 

Also, important to keep in mind whether the solutions can be **long-term**

### Specific solutions 
[[Fetzer_2022]] – scalable bioreactors 

[[YoonEtAl_2009]] – an earlier example of using methanotrophic biotrickling filters. They didn't actually build the filter but did mathematical modeling to predict how much methane it could remove under different conditions 

[[GirardEtAl_2011]] – used and measured an actual biofilter, so an advancement from Yoon et al (2009). May be useful to compare the results from the two studies. 

[[Silva-TeiraEtAl_2017]] – membrane bioreactor (MBR) for methane removal from wastewater. Microbes use methane as a carbon source for denitrification (so could tackle two GHGs at once?)

There seem to be a lot of studies on methanotrophs and how they oxidise methane – this could be biochemistry's contribution to long-term methane control, i.e. the study of methanotrophs and the biochemical process of methane oxidation, and how to optimise it for use. As well as discovery, characterisation of methanotrophs 

## Long-term characteristics 
- Can the solution be maintained at high efficiency over a long period of time? – possible with certain configurations of biological systems 

## Areas for future research
- Methanotroph strain engineering 
- Enzyme engineering (does immobilisation of purified enzymes on a solid matrix work? Or too unstable?)
